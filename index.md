# Technical Documentation

Welcome to my personal technical documentation site. This contains guides, configurations, and best practices for various technologies I work with. Nearly all of this is just a place for me to store things I may want to reference later. If it is helpful to you, great. If not...sorry. I will gladly return twice the amount of money you paid me for access to this site (That's $0.00 for those who haven't had your coffee yet).

Written in markdown and served up with docfx and hosted on GitHub Pages. The site itself is something of an experiment as I play with these technologies and try out different things.
