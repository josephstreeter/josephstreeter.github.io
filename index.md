# Welcome

This has been a sort of online notebook of mine for years. This is a work in progress and probably always will be. If it were 1998 there would likely be a flashing construction barricade flashing at the top.

Written in markdown and served up with docfx and hosted on GitHub Pages. The site itself is something of an experiment as I play with these technologies and try out different things.

Refer to following resources to learn more:

## Purpose

There are several different areas covered on this site. Nearly all of this is just a place for me to store things I may want to reference later. If it is helpful to you, great. If not...sorry. I will gladly return twice the amount of money you paid me for access to this site (That's $0.00 for those who haven't had your coffee yet).

1. Technology - Everything from my home lab to things I may use at work and all the way to my trail cameras.
2. Photography - Basic concepts and information about photography. The kinds of things that I find myself explaining over and over again when someone asks. I sometimes struggle to find resources to give to people, so here ya go, a link to my site.
3. Cooking - By "cooking," I really just mean the things that I do on a smoker of griddle.
