## 📡 Wireless Network Design

### Access Point Placement

```text
Fall River Home Layout
Main Floor
├── AP-1 (Living Room) - Primary coverage
├── AP-2 (Kitchen) - High-density area
└── AP-3 (Home Office) - Administrative access

Floor 2 (if applicable)
├── AP-4 (Master Bedroom) - Extended coverage
└── AP-5 (Guest Room) - Guest access

Each AP broadcasts:
├── HomeNet-Trusted (VLAN 101) - Administrative devices
├── HomeNet-Secure (VLAN 103) - Infrastructure access
├── HomeNet-IoT (VLAN 106) - Smart home devices
├── HomeNet-Gaming (VLAN 108) - Gaming devices
└── HomeNet-Guest (VLAN 104) - Guest access
```

### SSID Configuration

| SSID Name | VLAN | Security | Purpose |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| HomeNet-Trusted | 101 | WPA3-Enterprise + MAC filtering | Administrative devices |
| HomeNet-Secure | 103 | WPA3-Enterprise + Certificates | Infrastructure access |
| HomeNet-IoT | 106 | WPA3-PSK | Smart home devices |
| HomeNet-Gaming | 108 | WPA3-PSK | Gaming consoles |
| HomeNet-Guest | 104 | WPA3-PSK + Captive Portal | Guest access |
| HomeNet-VPN | 105 | WPA3-Enterprise | VPN client access |

## 🔄 Traffic Flow Patterns

### Typical Traffic Flows

1. **Administrative Access**

   ```text
   Admin Device (VLAN 101) → Proxmox Node (VLAN 127) → VM Management
   ```

2. **IoT Device → Smart Home Hub**

   ```text
   IoT Device (VLAN 106) → Home Assistant (VLAN 127) → Database (VLAN 103)
   ```

3. **Gaming Console → Internet**

   ```text
   Gaming Device (VLAN 108) → DNS (VLAN 103) → Internet Gateway
   ```

4. **VPN Client → Internal Services**

   ```text
   VPN Client (VLAN 105) → Authentication (VLAN 103) → Server (VLAN 127)
   ```

5. **Security Camera → NVR**

   ```text
   IP Camera (VLAN 107) → NVR Server (VLAN 127) → Storage
   ```

### Load Balancing Strategy

- **DNS Round Robin** - For multiple instances of services
- **Nginx Load Balancing** - For web applications
- **Proxmox HA** - For VM failover
- **UniFi Load Balancing** - For wireless clients

## 📊 Monitoring and Visibility

### Network Monitoring Points

- **UniFi Controller** - Wireless and switch monitoring
- **Prometheus/Grafana** - Network metrics and alerting
- **PRTG or LibreNMS** - SNMP monitoring
- **Wazuh** - Security event correlation

### Key Metrics

- **Bandwidth Utilization** - Per VLAN and interface
- **Connection Counts** - Active sessions and flows
- **Error Rates** - Packet loss and retransmissions
- **Security Events** - Blocked connections and intrusions

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

### Fall River Site Specifics

- **Location**: Fall River home lab
- **Network Range**: 192.168.x.0/24 (where x = VLAN ID)
- **Gateway**: UniFi Dream Machine Pro
- **Primary DNS**: 192.168.103.1 (Internal)
- **Secondary DNS**: 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1 (External)

### Security Considerations

- **Default Deny**: All inter-VLAN communication blocked by default
- **Explicit Allow**: Only required services permitted
- **Monitoring**: All traffic logged and monitored
- **Updates**: Regular security patching and updates

---

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Start with a simple VLAN design and add complexity gradually. Proper documentation and labeling are crucial for troubleshooting and maintenance.

*This network topology provides security through segmentation while maintaining flexibility for growth and experimentation in the Fall River home lab environment.*
