## Troubleshooting

## Error: The repository '<https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu> bookworm Release' does not have a Release file

If you attempt to install Docker on Proxmox using the official Docker package manager steps, you may encounter this error.

```terminal
Hit:5 http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm InRelease
Hit:6 http://download.proxmox.com/debian/ceph-quincy bookworm InRelease
Ign:7 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bookworm InRelease
Err:8 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bookworm Release
  404  Not Found [IP: 54.230.202.11 443]
Reading package lists... Done
E: The repository 'https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bookworm Release' does not have a Release file.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.
```

### Why This Happens

Proxmox is based on Debian, not Ubuntu. The Docker repository for Ubuntu Bookworm does not exist, but there is one for Debian Bookworm. The default instructions from the Docker website may add an Ubuntu source, causing this error.

### Solution: Use Debian Instead of Ubuntu in apt Sources

1. Open the Docker repository source file for editing (commonly `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list`).
2. Change the entry from `ubuntu` to `debian`:

    ```text
    # From:
    deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu   bookworm stable
    # To:
    deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian   bookworm stable
    ```

3. Save the file and run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

This should resolve the error and allow you to install Docker on Proxmox successfully.

> **Tip:** Always verify your distribution and codename when adding third-party repositories to avoid compatibility issues.
