# Network Security Architecture

## Overview

Comprehensive network security design patterns and implementations for enterprise environments.

## Architecture Components

### Perimeter Security

- Next-generation firewalls
- Intrusion detection/prevention systems
- DDoS protection services

### Internal Network Security

- Network segmentation strategies
- VLAN isolation and access controls
- Zero trust network architecture

### Monitoring and Response

- Security information and event management (SIEM)
- Network behavior analytics
- Automated threat response

## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Assessment

1. Current network inventory
2. Security gap analysis
3. Risk assessment and prioritization

### Phase 2: Design

1. Security architecture blueprint
2. Network segmentation plan
3. Access control matrix

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Phased deployment approach
2. Testing and validation
3. Documentation and training

## Best Practices

- Implement defense in depth
- Regular security assessments
- Continuous monitoring
- Incident response planning
