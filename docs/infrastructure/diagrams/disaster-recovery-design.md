    participant Primary as Primary Database
    participant Replica as Secondary Replica
    participant DR as DR Site Database
    participant Monitor as Replication Monitor
    
    Primary->>Replica: Synchronous Replication
    Primary->>DR: Asynchronous Replication
    Primary->>Monitor: Replication Status
    Replica->>Monitor: Health Check
    DR->>Monitor: Replication Lag
    Monitor->>Primary: Performance Metrics
    
    Note over Primary,DR: Continuous Data Protection
    Note over Monitor: Real-time Monitoring
```

#### Storage Replication

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Replication lag monitoring
- Backup job status tracking
- DR site health checks
- Network connectivity monitoring
- Performance baseline comparison

## Cost Optimization

### DR Cost Management

1. **Tiered Recovery Strategy**
   - Match recovery requirements to business criticality
   - Use appropriate technology for each tier
   - Regular cost-benefit analysis

2. **Cloud DR Solutions**
   - Pay-as-you-go model
   - Reserved capacity for critical systems
   - Automated scaling during disasters

3. **Resource Optimization**
   - Right-sizing DR infrastructure
   - Shared DR sites for multiple applications
   - Regular capacity planning reviews

## Compliance and Governance

### Regulatory Requirements

- Data residency requirements
- Recovery time mandates
- Audit trail maintenance
- Compliance reporting

### Documentation Standards

- DR procedures documentation
- Test result records
- Incident response logs
- Change management records
