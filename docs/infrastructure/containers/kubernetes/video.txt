1. Self‑Hosted Kubernetes Cluster on Virtual Machines
Use an environment like Proxmox VE to create your own cluster across multiple VMs.

Deploy a controller node and worker nodes to manage workloads.

This setup gives hands‑on exposure to cluster architecture, IP addressing, and basic node management

2. Install a Load Balancer & Ingress Controller
Add networking automation with NGINX Ingress Controller or a similar tool.

Learn how to route external traffic into cluster services.

This project covers DNS, HTTP routing, and exposes applications through configurable ingress rules

3. Deploy Self‑Hosted Web Apps
Host simple applications (e.g. static site, CMS, or microservice) on your locally managed cluster.

Practice writing manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress), scaling pods, and managing updates.

Witness Kubernetes self‑healing by killing pods and observing auto-recreation behavior

4. Explore Kubernetes Management Tools
Briefly introduces GUI tools and third‑party dashboards for easier cluster oversight.

Gain comfort with continuous maintenance, cluster monitoring, and visualization

🚀 Why These Projects Matter
Hands‑On Experience from Day One
Rather than just theoretical concepts, Lempa emphasizes real-world practice—from bootstrapping a cluster to deploying real applications with ingress support. This builds familiarity with both the infrastructure and object-level Kubernetes concepts (Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress).

Incremental Learning Path
Each project builds on the previous. You begin with setting up infrastructure, then learn how to route traffic, deploy apps, and finally use tools for monitoring and maintenance. This structure is ideal for structured learning in a home lab.

Realistic Learning Environment
Running Kubernetes on VMs reflects many real-world scenarios (DIY homelab, cloud dev zones). You’ll face practical issues like IP assignment, resource allocation, and pod scheduling—precisely the types of problems engineers confront in production.

📚 Project Ideas Inspired by Broader Learning Resources
To enrich your learning journey further, here are some related beginner project ideas and tutorials:

✅ Quick‑Start Step‑by‑Step Checklist
Set up your homelab:

Create a cluster using Proxmox or alternatives (Minikube, K3s).

Configure at least one control plane and one worker node.

Install essential components:

Load balancer (e.g., MetalLB if in bare‑metal VM environment).

Ingress controller (NGINX or Traefik).

Deploy a sample application:

Write Kubernetes manifests:

Deployment for your app.

Service to expose it.

Ingress for external traffic routing.

Manage and scale your app:

Scale pods up/down.

Delete a pod manually to trigger Kubernetes self‑healing.

Add visibility and control tools:

Examine dashboards and UI tools for cluster monitoring.

Experiment with resource usage and node state.

🧠 Final Thoughts
Christian Lempa’s video offers a clear, actionable path for anyone new to Kubernetes. These projects are practical, approachable, and scalable in complexity. Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can tackle more advanced workflows like Helm charts, CI/CD integration, network policies, and multi‑cluster operations.
