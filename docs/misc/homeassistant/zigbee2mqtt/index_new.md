## Overview

**Zigbee2MQTT** is a powerful bridge that allows you to use your Zigbee devices without the vendor's bridge or gateway. It bridges events and allows you to control your Zigbee devices via MQTT, making them compatible with any smart home solution that supports MQTT, including Home Assistant, OpenHAB, and Node-RED.

## What is Zigbee2MQTT?

Zigbee2MQTT is an open-source project that:

- **Eliminates vendor lock-in** by removing the need for proprietary hubs
- **Provides local control** without cloud dependencies
- **Supports 2000+ devices** from various manufacturers
- **Enables advanced features** not available in vendor apps
- **Offers extensive customization** through configuration files
- **Provides detailed logging** for troubleshooting

### Key Benefits

- **Cost-effective**: Single adapter supports multiple device brands
- **Privacy-focused**: All communication stays local
- **Flexible**: Works with any MQTT-compatible automation platform
- **Feature-rich**: Exposes all device capabilities
- **Community-driven**: Extensive device support and documentation
