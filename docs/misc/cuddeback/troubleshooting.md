# Troubleshooting Guide

Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for Cuddeback trail cameras and CuddeLink network issues.

## Quick Reference

| Issue Type | Common Cause | Quick Fix |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| No Signal | Channel Mismatch | Verify all cameras use same channel |
| Weak Signal | Distance/Obstacles | Move closer or remove obstacles |
| Won't Turn On | Dead Batteries | Replace with fresh batteries |
| SD Card Error | Card Format | Reformat SD card (FAT32) |

## Network Connectivity Issues

### Signal Strength Problems

#### Poor or No Signal Connection

Common symptoms and solutions:

- **Weak signal (below 20)** → Move camera closer to HOME or add repeater
- **No signal detection** → Check channel settings match between cameras  
- **Intermittent connection** → Test different channels to avoid interference
- **Signal drops during deployment** → Identify obstacles and find better positioning

### Configuration Errors

#### Camera Mode Issues

- **Wrong mode setting** → Verify HOME vs REMOTE vs REPEATER configuration
- **REPEATER cameras not capturing** → Remember REPEATER mode only relays images
- **Multiple HOME cameras** → Only one camera should be set to HOME mode

#### Network Setup Problems

- **Channel mismatch** → Ensure all cameras use identical channel (1-16)
- **Duplicate camera IDs** → Assign unique LINK ID to each camera
- **Range limitations** → Plan network topology with proper spacing

## Hardware Troubleshooting

### Power and Battery Issues

#### Camera Won't Start

- Replace batteries with fresh alkaline or lithium batteries
- Check battery orientation and clean terminals if corroded
- Test with external power adapter if available
- Verify camera hasn't been damaged by moisture or impact

#### Battery Life Problems

- Use lithium batteries in cold weather conditions
- Optimize camera settings to reduce power consumption
- Install latest firmware for improved power efficiency
- Consider external power sources for remote locations

### Interface and Display Issues

#### LCD Display Problems

- Power cycle camera (remove batteries for 30 seconds)
- Clean display screen gently with microfiber cloth
- Allow camera to warm up in extreme cold conditions
- Perform factory reset if display remains unresponsive

#### Control Button Issues

- Clean around buttons with compressed air to remove debris
- Check for moisture inside camera housing
- Test different button combinations to isolate problem
- Contact support if buttons remain completely unresponsive

### Storage and Image Quality

#### SD Card Errors

- Reformat SD card using FAT32 file system
- Try different SD card brands (use recommended types)
- Clean SD card contacts with dry cloth
- Check card capacity limits (consult camera specifications)

#### Image Quality Issues

- Clean camera lens with microfiber cloth
- Verify photo resolution and quality settings
- Test in different lighting conditions
- Update firmware for image processing improvements

## Environmental Challenges

### Weather Protection

#### Moisture Problems

- Inspect and replace weatherproof seals regularly
- Add desiccant packs inside camera housing
- Mount camera at downward angle to shed water
- Allow complete drying before reassembly after moisture exposure

#### Temperature Extremes

- Use lithium batteries for cold weather operation
- Provide additional insulation in extreme cold
- Ensure adequate ventilation in hot conditions
- Position cameras to minimize direct sunlight exposure

### Security and Wildlife

#### Theft Prevention

- Install cameras in steel security enclosures
- Use cable locks and tamper-resistant mounting
- Camouflage camera locations and mount at appropriate height
- Consider hidden backup cameras for critical locations

## Advanced Diagnostics

### Built-in Testing Tools

#### TEST Mode Functions

- Image capture verification
- LED indicator diagnostics
