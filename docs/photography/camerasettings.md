# Camera Settings

## Basics

The three fundamental camera settings are:

- **Aperture**: Controls the size of the lens opening, affecting the amount of light entering the camera and the depth of field (background blur).
- **Shutter Speed**: Determines how long the camera's sensor is exposed to light, affecting motion blur and exposure.
- **ISO**: Adjusts the sensor's sensitivity to light, impacting exposure and image noise.

## Exposure

Exposure is the result of the combined effect of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. These three settings form the **exposure triangle**:

- Increasing aperture (lower f-number) lets in more light but reduces depth of field.
- Slower shutter speeds allow more light but can introduce motion blur.
- Higher ISO increases sensitivity but can add noise to the image.

Balancing these settings allows you to achieve the desired brightness and creative effect in your photos.

**Example:**

- For low-light situations, you might use a wider aperture, slower shutter speed, or higher ISO.
- For action shots, use a fast shutter speed to freeze motion, possibly with a wider aperture or higher ISO to maintain proper exposure.
