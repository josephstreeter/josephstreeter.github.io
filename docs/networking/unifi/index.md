## Unifi Network Management

This guide covers the configuration, management, and optimization of Ubiquiti UniFi networking equipment.

## UniFi Product Overview

UniFi offers a comprehensive suite of networking products that can be centrally managed through the UniFi Controller:

- **UniFi Dream Machine (UDM)**: All-in-one router, switch, and access point
- **UniFi Access Points**: Wireless network devices for different environments
- **UniFi Switches**: Managed switches with PoE options
- **UniFi Security Gateway**: Advanced routing and security features
- **UniFi Protect**: Video surveillance system

## Getting Started with UniFi

### Initial Setup

1. **Controller Installation**

   The UniFi Controller can be installed on various platforms:

   - **Cloud Key**: Dedicated hardware controller
   - **UDM/UDM Pro**: Built-in controller
   - **Self-hosted**: Install on Windows, macOS, Linux, or Docker

2. **Accessing the Controller**

   ```text
   https://unifi.local:8443
   # or
   https://<controller-ip>:8443
   ```

3. **Basic Configuration**

   - Create admin account
   - Set up site information
   - Configure basic network settings (DHCP, DNS, etc.)
   - Adopt devices into the network

### Network Design Best Practices

1. **Wireless Network Planning**
   - Conduct site survey for optimal AP placement
   - Configure appropriate channels and channel width
   - Set appropriate transmit power levels

2. **VLAN Strategy**
   - Segment network for security and performance
   - Create separate networks for IoT, guest, and trusted devices
   - Implement appropriate firewall rules between networks

3. **Security Implementation**
   - Enable IDS/IPS features
   - Configure WPA3 where possible
   - Implement 802.1X authentication for enterprise environments
   - Create guest portal for visitor access

## Advanced Configuration

### Performance Optimization

- **Fast Roaming**
  - Enable 802.11r for seamless handoff between APs
  - Configure minimum RSSI thresholds
  - Optimize band steering settings

- **Quality of Service (QoS)**
  - Prioritize critical traffic
  - Limit bandwidth for non-essential services
  - Create traffic shaping rules

### Remote Access

- **UniFi Cloud Access**
  - Enable remote management
  - Configure two-factor authentication
  - Set up notifications for important events

- **VPN Configuration**
  - Set up L2TP, OpenVPN, or WireGuard
  - Configure split tunneling if needed
  - Implement proper access controls

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connectivity Problems

- **Client Connection Issues**
  - Check for interference
  - Verify DHCP server function
  - Test with multiple devices to isolate the problem

- **Performance Degradation**
  - Examine network topology
  - Check for bottlenecks
  - Monitor RF environment for interference

### Controller Issues

- **Device Adoption Problems**
  - Verify L2 connectivity
  - Check firewall rules
  - Reset device to factory settings if needed
  - Verify inform URL is correct

- **Controller Disconnections**
  - Check MongoDB status
  - Verify adequate resources
  - Review logs for errors

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- **Firmware Updates**
  - Review release notes
  - Test updates in non-production environment
  - Schedule maintenance windows

- **Configuration Backup**
  - Regularly export controller settings
  - Store backups securely
  - Test restoration procedures

### Monitoring Best Practices

- **Dashboard Utilization**
  - Monitor client count and distribution
  - Track bandwidth usage
  - Review alerts and notifications

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Track wireless experience metrics
  - Monitor latency and packet loss
  - Identify problematic clients
