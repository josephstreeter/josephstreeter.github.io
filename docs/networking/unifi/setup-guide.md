This comprehensive guide walks you through the complete setup and configuration of a UniFi network, from initial installation to advanced optimization for maximum performance.

## Overview

This guide covers setting up a UniFi network using a UniFi Cloud Gateway Ultra as the controller with UniFi access points. We'll configure a typical home network with:

- Main wireless network
- Guest network for visitors
- Kids network with content filtering
- IoT network for smart home devices
- Proper security and optimization settings

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

- **UniFi Cloud Gateway or Console** (Cloud Gateway Ultra, Dream Machine, etc.)
- **UniFi Access Points** (6 Lite, 6 Pro, 7 Pro, etc.)
- **Network Cable** (Cat6 recommended)
- **Power Supply** or PoE injector for access points
- **Internet Connection** via modem or ISP router

### Software Requirements

- **Ubiquiti Account** (recommended for cloud access)
- **Web Browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Step 1: Initial Setup Process

### Mobile App Setup (Recommended)

1. **Prepare the Hardware**
   - Connect the WAN port of your Cloud Gateway to your internet source
   - Connect power and wait 2-3 minutes for boot up
   - Download and install the UniFi Network app on your mobile device

2. **Initial Configuration**
   - Open the UniFi Network app
   - Sign in to your Ubiquiti account or create a new one
   - Tap the "+" icon to discover your new console
   - Once detected, tap "Tap to Setup"

3. **Console Configuration**
   - Give your console a descriptive name (e.g., "Home Network")
   - Configure the initial wireless network (can be changed later)
   - Set the admin password for local access
   - Enable traffic prioritization if desired

4. **Complete Setup**
   - Review your settings
   - Click "Connect" to finish the initial setup
   - Wait for the setup process to complete

### Web Browser Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use the mobile app:

1. Connect a laptop to the network
2. Open a browser and navigate to `http://192.168.1.1`
3. Follow the web-based setup wizard
4. Configure the same settings as above

## Step 2: Update UniFi Apps and OS Settings

### Access the Console

1. **Login to Cloud Management**
   - Go to [unifi.ui.com](https://unifi.ui.com/)
   - Sign in with your Ubiquiti account
   - Click on your console to access the Site Manager
