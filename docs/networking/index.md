# Networking

This section covers networking concepts, protocols, configuration guides, and troubleshooting for various networking equipment and software.

## Topics

- [Unifi Dream Machine](unifi/index.md) - Configuration and operation of the Unifi networking equipment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving into networking topics, it's helpful to have:

1. **Basic Knowledge**:
   - Understanding of IP addressing and subnetting
   - Familiarity with OSI model and basic networking concepts
   - Knowledge of common protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP)

2. **Tools for Network Analysis**:
   - Wireshark or tcpdump for packet analysis
   - Ping and traceroute utilities
   - SSH client for device access

3. **Lab Environment** (optional but recommended):
   - Virtual network with GNS3 or Packet Tracer
   - Small physical lab with switches and routers

### First Steps

#### 1. Understanding Network Fundamentals

Start with these fundamental concepts:

- **IP Addressing**: Learn IPv4/IPv6 addressing and subnetting
- **Network Protocols**: Understand TCP, UDP, ICMP, and application protocols
- **Network Devices**: Learn the functions of routers, switches, firewalls

#### 2. Hands-on Practice

For Unifi equipment:

```bash
# Access Unifi Controller
https://unifi.local:8443

# Basic troubleshooting commands
ping 8.8.8.8
traceroute google.com
nslookup example.com
```

For general networking diagnostics:

```bash
# Check interface status
ip addr show

# View routing table
ip route

# Scan open ports on a server
nmap -A 192.168.1.1
```

### Common Tasks

#### Configuring a Network Device

1. Connect to device via SSH or console
2. Enter configuration mode
3. Set IP addresses, VLANs, and routing parameters
4. Save configuration

#### Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues

1. Verify physical connectivity (cables, link lights)
2. Check IP configuration (address, subnet mask, gateway)
3. Test local network connectivity (ping local gateway)
4. Test internet connectivity (ping public DNS)
5. Examine routing tables and firewall rules

### Next Steps

- Learn about [VLANs and network segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN)
- Explore [network security best practices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html)
- Study [routing protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol) (OSPF, BGP, EIGRP)
