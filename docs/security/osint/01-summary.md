## OSINT Summary and Overview

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of collecting, analyzing, and utilizing information that is publicly available to produce actionable intelligence. This discipline has evolved from traditional intelligence gathering methods to encompass the vast digital landscape of the modern internet.

## What is OSINT?

**Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** refers to intelligence gathered from publicly available sources. These sources include:

- **Public websites and databases**
- **Social media platforms**
- **News articles and publications**
- **Government records and reports**
- **Academic research and papers**
- **Commercial databases**
- **Multimedia content (images, videos, audio)**

> [!NOTE]
> The term "open source" in OSINT refers to publicly available information, not to be confused with open-source software.

## Core OSINT Principles

This section introduces the foundational principles that guide ethical and effective OSINT practice. It explains the importance of relying solely on publicly available information, adhering to legal and ethical standards, and rigorously verifying and validating collected data. By understanding these core principles, practitioners can ensure their intelligence activities are responsible, credible, and compliant with relevant laws and guidelines.

### 1. Public Information Only

OSINT strictly uses information that is:

- Publicly accessible
- Legally obtainable
- Available without authentication or payment

### 2. Ethical Collection

All OSINT activities must:

- Respect privacy and legal boundaries
- Follow terms of service
- Maintain professional ethics
- Avoid harmful or malicious activities

### 3. Verification and Validation

Information must be:

- Cross-referenced from multiple sources
- Verified for accuracy and currency
- Assessed for reliability and credibility
- Properly documented and attributed
