## OpenSSL Guide

## Overview

OpenSSL is a robust, full-featured open-source toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols along with a comprehensive cryptography library. This guide covers the fundamental concepts and practical usage of OpenSSL for certificate management, encryption, and cryptographic operations.

OpenSSL serves as a cornerstone for secure communications on the internet and is widely used for:

- Creating and managing digital certificates and certificate authorities
- Securing web servers and client communications
- Implementing secure authentication mechanisms
- Encrypting sensitive data and communications
- Testing and validating SSL/TLS implementations
- Developing secure applications that require cryptographic operations

As one of the most widely deployed security solutions, OpenSSL powers approximately 70% of all web servers and is integrated into countless security-critical applications worldwide.

## OpenSSL Versions

OpenSSL has evolved significantly over time with important security improvements in each major release. Understanding version differences is crucial when working across different environments.

### Version History

| Version | Release Date | Key Features | Notes |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| 3.x     | 2021+        | Provider architecture, improved FIPS support, new commands | Current stable series |
| 1.1.1   | 2018-2023    | TLS 1.3 support, improved security | Long-term support release (Extended to 2023) |
| 1.0.2   | 2014-2019    | TLS 1.2, Suite B | End of life |
| 0.9.8   | 2005-2015    | Early widespread version | Obsolete, contains known vulnerabilities |

### Version Verification

Always verify the OpenSSL version in your environment before executing commands, as syntax and capabilities may vary:

```bash
# Display full version information
openssl version -a

# Check if your version supports a specific feature (e.g., TLS 1.3)
openssl ciphers -v | grep TLSv1.3
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using outdated OpenSSL versions may expose your systems to known security vulnerabilities. Always use the latest stable version when possible, and avoid versions older than 1.1.1 for production environments.

## Installation

OpenSSL is included in most Linux distributions and macOS by default, but you may need to install or update it to access the latest features and security patches.

### Linux

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev

# Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora
sudo yum install openssl openssl-devel

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S openssl

# Verify installation
openssl version -a
```

### Windows

Windows doesn't include OpenSSL by default. You have several installation options:

```powershell
# Using Chocolatey (preferred method)
choco install openssl

# Using Scoop
scoop install openssl

# Using winget
winget install ShiningLight.OpenSSL

# Verify installation
openssl version -a
```

Alternatively, you can download precompiled binaries from the [official OpenSSL website](https://www.openssl.org/source/) or [Win32/Win64 OpenSSL Installer](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).

> [!TIP]
> For Windows, ensure OpenSSL is added to your PATH environment variable after installation. You can check this by running `where openssl` in a command prompt.

### macOS

macOS comes with OpenSSL, but it's often an older version. Use Homebrew to install the latest version:

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install openssl

# OpenSSL installed via Homebrew is typically installed at:
# /usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/ or /usr/local/opt/openssl@3

# Add to your PATH (add to your .bash_profile or .zshrc)
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify installation
openssl version -a
```

### Environment Variables

After installation, consider setting these environment variables for easier OpenSSL usage:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS, add to .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .zshrc
export OPENSSL_CONF=/path/to/openssl.cnf
export SSL_CERT_DIR=/path/to/certs
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/cert.pem

# For Windows (PowerShell)
$env:OPENSSL_CONF = "C:\path\to\openssl.cnf"
$env:SSL_CERT_DIR = "C:\path\to\certs"
$env:SSL_CERT_FILE = "C:\path\to\cert.pem"
```

### Verifying a Proper Installation

Ensure your installation is working correctly by performing a simple test:

```bash
# Generate a test key
openssl genrsa -out test.key 2048

# Create a test certificate
openssl req -new -key test.key -x509 -out test.crt -subj "/CN=test" -days 1

# Clean up
rm test.key test.crt

# If these commands complete without errors, your installation is working properly
```

## Basic Concepts

### Key Concepts in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

- **Public Key Cryptography**: Asymmetric encryption using key pairs where data encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. This forms the foundation of secure communications on the internet.

- **X.509 Certificates**: Standardized digital document format that binds a public key to an identity. Contains information about the key, the identity of its owner (called the subject), the digital signature of the entity that verified the certificate's contents (the issuer), and a validity period.

- **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**: Trusted entities that issue and sign certificates after verifying the identity of the certificate applicant. Examples include commercial CAs like DigiCert, Let's Encrypt, and Sectigo, as well as private CAs established within organizations.

- **Certificate Chains**: A hierarchical trust structure consisting of a root CA certificate, zero or more intermediate CA certificates, and end-entity certificates. This chain establishes a path of trust from end-entity certificates to trusted root CAs.

- **Root Certificates**: Self-signed certificates at the top of trust chains, representing the ultimate trust anchor in PKI. Operating systems and browsers come pre-installed with a set of trusted root certificates.

- **Certificate Revocation**: The process of invalidating certificates before their expiration date using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).

### Cryptographic Concepts

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, 3DES).

- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses key pairs - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA, ECC).

- **Hash Functions**: One-way functions that convert data of any size to a fixed-size output (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-3).

- **Digital Signatures**: Created by encrypting a hash of the message with the sender's private key, providing authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity.

### OpenSSL Architecture

OpenSSL consists of three main components:

1. **SSL/TLS Library**: Implements the SSL and TLS protocols for secure communications
2. **Cryptographic Library**: Provides general-purpose cryptographic functions
3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Offers tools for various cryptographic operations

### OpenSSL Configuration File

The OpenSSL configuration file (`openssl.cnf`) defines default settings used by OpenSSL commands. Its location varies by system:

- Linux: `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf` or `/usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf`
- macOS: `/usr/local/etc/openssl/openssl.cnf` or `/opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@3/openssl.cnf`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.cfg`

You can specify a different configuration file using the `-config` flag or by setting the `OPENSSL_CONF` environment variable.

### Common OpenSSL Commands

OpenSSL provides a rich set of commands for different cryptographic operations:

```bash
# Display OpenSSL version
openssl version -a

# Display all available commands
openssl help

# Display help for a specific command
openssl x509 -help

# List available ciphers
openssl ciphers -v

# List available elliptic curves
openssl ecparam -list_curves

# Generate a random sequence of bytes
openssl rand -base64 32

# Encrypt a file with AES-256
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in plaintext.txt -out encrypted.bin

# Decrypt an encrypted file
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in encrypted.bin -out decrypted.txt
```

### Command Structure

Most OpenSSL commands follow this general structure:

```bash
openssl command [command_options] [command_arguments]
```

Where:

- `command`: The primary operation (e.g., `x509`, `req`, `genrsa`)
- `command_options`: Flags that modify the command's behavior
- `command_arguments`: Input/output files and other parameters

## Certificate Operations

OpenSSL provides a robust set of tools for creating, inspecting, and managing X.509 certificates. This section covers the most common certificate operations.

### Creating Self-Signed Certificates

Self-signed certificates are useful for development environments, internal services, and testing:

```bash
# Generate a self-signed certificate valid for 365 days
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private.key -out certificate.crt -days 365 -nodes

# Generate a self-signed certificate with subject information
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private.key -out certificate.crt -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/OU=Department/CN=example.com"
```

For a comprehensive guide on self-signed certificates, see the [Self-Signed Certificates](self-signed.md) page.

### Viewing Certificate Information

Inspect certificate details to verify content and configuration:

```bash
# View complete certificate information in text format
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout

# View certificate issuer
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -issuer -noout

# View certificate subject
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -subject -noout

# View certificate validity dates
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -dates -noout

# View certificate fingerprint (SHA-256)
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -fingerprint -sha256 -noout

# Check the certificate's purpose
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -purpose -noout

# Extract the public key from a certificate
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -pubkey -noout > pubkey.pem

# Check extensions (including SANs)
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout | grep -A 10 "X509v3 Subject Alternative Name"
```

### Creating a Certificate Authority (CA)

Setting up your own CA is useful for managing certificates within an organization:

```bash
# 1. Create a directory structure for your CA
mkdir -p ca/{certs,crl,newcerts,private}
touch ca/index.txt
echo 1000 > ca/serial

# 2. Create a CA configuration file
cat > ca.conf << EOF
[ ca ]
default_ca = CA_default

[ CA_default ]
dir               = ./ca
certs             = \$dir/certs
crl_dir           = \$dir/crl
new_certs_dir     = \$dir/newcerts
database          = \$dir/index.txt
serial            = \$dir/serial
RANDFILE          = \$dir/private/.rand

private_key       = \$dir/private/ca.key
certificate       = \$dir/certs/ca.crt

crl               = \$dir/crl/ca.crl
crlnumber         = \$dir/crlnumber
crl_extensions    = crl_ext
default_crl_days  = 30

default_md        = sha256
name_opt          = ca_default
cert_opt          = ca_default
default_days      = 365
preserve          = no
policy            = policy_strict

[ policy_strict ]
countryName             = match
stateOrProvinceName     = match
organizationName        = match
organizationalUnitName  = optional
commonName              = supplied
emailAddress            = optional

[ req ]
default_bits        = 4096
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name
string_mask         = utf8only
default_md          = sha256
x509_extensions     = v3_ca

[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName                     = Country Name (2 letter code)
stateOrProvinceName             = State or Province Name
localityName                    = Locality Name
0.organizationName              = Organization Name
organizationalUnitName          = Organizational Unit Name
commonName                      = Common Name
emailAddress                    = Email Address

[ v3_ca ]
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer
basicConstraints = critical, CA:true
keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, cRLSign, keyCertSign

[ server_cert ]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
nsCertType = server
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Server Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer:always
keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
EOF

# 3. Create a private key for the CA
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca/private/ca.key 4096
chmod 400 ca/private/ca.key

# 4. Create a self-signed CA certificate
openssl req -config ca.conf -key ca/private/ca.key -new -x509 -days 3650 -sha256 \
  -extensions v3_ca -out ca/certs/ca.crt

# 5. Verify the CA certificate
openssl x509 -noout -text -in ca/certs/ca.crt
```

### Signing Certificates with Your CA

Once your CA is set up, you can sign certificate requests:

```bash
# 1. Create a server key and CSR
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=example.com"

# 2. Create a configuration file for the server certificate
cat > server.conf << EOF
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
nsCertType = server
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Server Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer:always
keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = example.com
DNS.2 = www.example.com
EOF

# 3. Sign the CSR with the CA
openssl ca -config ca.conf -extensions server_cert -days 365 -notext \
  -md sha256 -in server.csr -out server.crt -extfile server.conf

# 4. Verify the signed certificate
openssl verify -CAfile ca/certs/ca.crt server.crt
```

### Creating Certificates with Subject Alternative Names (SANs)

Modern browsers require SANs for proper certificate validation:

```bash
# 1. Create a configuration file for SANs
cat > san.conf << EOF
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
C = US
ST = State
L = City
O = Organization
CN = example.com

[v3_req]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = example.com
DNS.2 = www.example.com
DNS.3 = api.example.com
DNS.4 = admin.example.com
IP.1 = 192.168.1.1
EOF

# 2. Generate key and CSR with SANs
openssl req -new -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server_san.key \
  -out server_san.csr -config san.conf

# 3. Verify the SANs in the CSR
openssl req -in server_san.csr -noout -text | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
```

### Wildcard Certificates

Wildcard certificates secure a domain and all its first-level subdomains:

```bash
# Create a wildcard certificate configuration
cat > wildcard.conf << EOF
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
C = US
ST = State
L = City
O = Organization
CN = *.example.com

[v3_req]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = *.example.com
DNS.2 = example.com
EOF

# Generate a wildcard certificate (self-signed for testing)
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout wildcard.key -out wildcard.crt -config wildcard.conf
```

### Managing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)

When certificates need to be invalidated before expiry:

```bash
# Create a CRL configuration file
cat > crl.conf << EOF
[ ca ]
default_ca = CA_default

[ CA_default ]
dir = ./ca
database = \$dir/index.txt
crlnumber = \$dir/crlnumber

default_days = 30
default_crl_days = 30
default_md = sha256

[ crl_ext ]
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always
EOF

# Initialize CRL number
echo 01 > ca/crlnumber

# Generate a CRL
openssl ca -config crl.conf -gencrl -out ca/crl/ca.crl

# View CRL information
openssl crl -in ca/crl/ca.crl -text -noout

# Revoke a certificate
openssl ca -config ca.conf -revoke server.crt -crl_reason keyCompromise

# Generate updated CRL after revocation
openssl ca -config crl.conf -gencrl -out ca/crl/ca.crl
```

## Private Key Management

Proper management of private keys is critical for security. OpenSSL provides tools for generating, protecting, and verifying private keys.

### Generating Private Keys

```bash
# Generate an RSA private key (4096 bits)
openssl genrsa -out private.key 4096

# Generate an RSA private key with AES-256 encryption (password-protected)
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out encrypted_private.key 4096

# Generate an EC private key (using prime256v1 curve - NIST P-256)
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ec_private.key

# Generate an EC private key with explicit curve parameters
openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -param_enc explicit -out ec_explicit.key

# Generate an Ed25519 key (OpenSSL 1.1.1+)
openssl genpkey -algorithm ED25519 -out ed25519_private.key
```

### Key Types and Algorithms

OpenSSL supports various key types with different security characteristics:

| Key Type | Command | Bit Size | Security Level | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|---------------|----------|
| RSA      | genrsa  | 2048-4096 | Medium-High | General purpose, widely supported |
| ECC (P-256) | ecparam | 256 | High | Modern, efficient for mobile/IoT |
| ECC (P-384) | ecparam | 384 | Very High | Government/financial applications |
| Ed25519  | genpkey | 256 | High | Modern signatures, better performance |

> [!NOTE]
> For most applications, RSA 2048 provides sufficient security. For higher security requirements or performance-sensitive applications, consider ECC or Ed25519.

### Working with Encrypted Keys

Password protection adds an additional security layer to private keys:

```bash
# Encrypt an existing private key
openssl rsa -in unencrypted.key -aes256 -out encrypted.key

# Decrypt an encrypted private key (removes password protection)
openssl rsa -in encrypted.key -out decrypted.key

# Change the password on an encrypted key
openssl rsa -in encrypted.key -aes256 -out new_encrypted.key

# Check if a key is encrypted
openssl rsa -in key.pem -check -noout
# If encrypted, you'll be prompted for a password
```

### Verifying Private Keys

```bash
# Check a private key
openssl rsa -in private.key -check -noout

# Display private key components (modulus, exponents)
openssl rsa -in private.key -text -noout

# Check if a private key matches a certificate
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificate.crt | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in private.key | openssl md5
# If the outputs match, the key and certificate are a pair

# Check if a private key matches a CSR
openssl req -noout -modulus -in request.csr | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in private.key | openssl md5
# If the outputs match, the CSR was generated from this key
```

### Extracting Public Keys

```bash
# Extract public key from private key
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key

# Extract public key from certificate
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -pubkey -noout > public.key

# Extract public key from CSR
openssl req -in request.csr -pubkey -noout > public.key

# View public key details
openssl pkey -in public.key -pubin -text -noout
```

### Converting Key Formats

```bash
# Convert traditional RSA key to PKCS#8 format
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in private.key -out private.p8

# Convert to PKCS#8 with encryption
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in private.key -out encrypted.p8 -v2 aes-256-cbc

# Convert PKCS#8 to traditional format
openssl rsa -in private.p8 -out traditional.key

# Convert PEM to DER format
openssl rsa -in private.key -outform DER -out private.der

# Convert DER to PEM format
openssl rsa -in private.der -inform DER -out private.pem
```

### Key Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Keys**: Minimum 2048-bit RSA or 256-bit ECC
2. **Encrypt Private Keys**: Always use password protection for keys
3. **Restrict File Permissions**:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 private.key  # Only owner can read/write
   ```

4. **Secure Backup**: Maintain secure, encrypted backups of critical keys
5. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate keys according to your security policy
6. **Hardware Security**: For high-security environments, consider hardware security modules (HSMs)
7. **Passphrase Management**: Use a secure password manager for key passphrases

## CSR Creation and Management

### Creating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

```bash
# Generate a new private key and CSR
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout private.key -out request.csr

# Generate a CSR from an existing private key
openssl req -new -key private.key -out request.csr

# Generate a CSR with subject information
openssl req -new -key private.key -out request.csr \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/OU=Department/CN=example.com"
```

### Adding Subject Alternative Names (SANs)

```bash
# Create a configuration file for SAN
cat > san.conf << EOF
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
C = US
ST = State
L = City
O = Organization
OU = Department
CN = example.com

[v3_req]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = example.com
DNS.2 = www.example.com
DNS.3 = mail.example.com
IP.1 = 192.168.1.1
EOF

# Generate a CSR with SANs
openssl req -new -key private.key -out san_request.csr -config san.conf
```

### Verifying a CSR

```bash
# View CSR information
openssl req -in request.csr -text -noout

# Verify CSR signature
openssl req -in request.csr -verify -noout

# View CSR subject
openssl req -in request.csr -subject -noout
```

## Certificate Verification

### Verifying Certificate Chain

```bash
# Verify a certificate against a CA
openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt certificate.crt

# Verify a certificate against a CA bundle
openssl verify -CAfile ca_bundle.crt certificate.crt

# Verify a certificate with an intermediate CA
cat intermediate.crt ca.crt > chain.crt
openssl verify -CAfile chain.crt certificate.crt
```

### Checking Certificate Expiration

```bash
# Check certificate expiration date
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -dates -noout

# Check if a certificate has expired
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -checkend 0
# Returns 0 if the certificate hasn't expired, 1 if it has

# Check if a certificate will expire in the next 30 days (2592000 seconds)
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -checkend 2592000
```

### Verifying Certificate Purpose

```bash
# Check certificate purposes
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -purpose -noout
```

## Certificate Conversions

### Converting Between Formats

```bash
# PEM to DER format
openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -outform der -out certificate.der

# DER to PEM format
openssl x509 -in certificate.der -inform der -outform pem -out certificate.pem

# PEM to PKCS#12 (PFX) format
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey private.key -in certificate.crt -certfile ca.crt

# PKCS#12 (PFX) to PEM format
openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.pfx -out certificate.pem -nodes
```

### Working with PKCS#7 and PKCS#12

```bash
# Create a PKCS#7 file from certificates
openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile certificate.crt -out certificate.p7b

# Extract certificates from PKCS#7
openssl pkcs7 -in certificate.p7b -print_certs -out certificate.pem

# Split a PEM file containing multiple certificates
awk 'BEGIN {c=0} /BEGIN CERT/{c++} {print > "cert." c ".pem"}' < combined.pem
```

## SSL/TLS Testing

OpenSSL provides powerful tools for testing and troubleshooting SSL/TLS connections. These commands help you verify server configurations, identify misconfigurations, and diagnose connectivity issues.

### Testing SSL/TLS Connections

The `s_client` command creates an SSL/TLS client connection to a server, showing details about the handshake, certificates, and protocols:

```bash
# Basic connection test (HTTPS)
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443

# Test with Server Name Indication (SNI) - important for virtual hosts
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -servername example.com

# Display the full certificate chain
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -showcerts

# Save server certificate to a file
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -showcerts </dev/null | \
  sed -n '/-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/,/-----END CERTIFICATE-----/p' > certificate.pem

# Test a specific TLS version
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tls1_2
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tls1_3

# Force TLSv1.3 only
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tls1_3 -no_tls1_2 -no_tls1_1 -no_tls1

# Test STARTTLS for protocols like SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP
openssl s_client -connect mail.example.com:25 -starttls smtp
openssl s_client -connect mail.example.com:110 -starttls pop3
openssl s_client -connect mail.example.com:143 -starttls imap

# Check for certificate expiration
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates

# Bypass DNS resolution with IP connection
openssl s_client -connect 192.168.1.1:443 -servername example.com

# View all handshake details including session tickets and session resumption
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -state -debug
```

### Analyzing Connection Security

Evaluate various security aspects of an SSL/TLS connection:

```bash
# Check for SSL renegotiation support (security vulnerability)
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -reconnect

# Check for session resumption capability
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -reconnect -no_ticket

# Check for TLS compression (CRIME vulnerability)
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -compress

# Check for Heartbleed vulnerability (OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f)
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tlsextdebug 2>&1 | grep 'server extension "heartbeat"'

# Check support for TLS extensions
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tlsextdebug

# Check for secure renegotiation
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 | grep "Secure Renegotiation"

# Check for perfect forward secrecy
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 | grep "Server Temp Key"
```

### Testing SSL/TLS Ciphers

Evaluate cipher support and security configuration:

```bash
# Check which cipher is used for a connection
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -cipher 'ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384'

# List all supported ciphers by your OpenSSL installation
openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:eNULL'

# List only strong ciphers
openssl ciphers -v 'HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!3DES:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS'

# List elliptic curve ciphers only
openssl ciphers -v 'ECDHE:ECDH:ECDSA'

# Check if a server supports a specific cipher
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -cipher 'ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384'
# If the connection succeeds, the server supports this cipher

# Test if server prefers its own cipher order (more secure)
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 2>&1 | grep "Server Temp Key"
```

### Creating a Test SSL/TLS Server

You can also create a simple test server to verify client connections:

```bash
# Create a self-signed certificate for testing
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"

# Start a simple SSL/TLS server on port 4433
openssl s_server -key server.key -cert server.crt -accept 4433 -www

# Connect to your test server with a client
openssl s_client -connect localhost:4433
```

### Advanced Testing and Diagnostics

```bash
# Check SSL/TLS session parameters and ticket information
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -status -tlsextdebug

# Check OCSP stapling support
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -status | grep -A 10 "OCSP response"

# Test mutual TLS authentication (client certificate)
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -cert client.crt -key client.key

# Capture detailed handshake timing
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -debug -msg -state -time

# Validate certificate against Mozilla's included CA list
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs

# Test TLS protocol version negotiation (downgrade attack protection)
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -no_tls1_3
```

### Interpreting Connection Results

When using `s_client`, look for these key indicators:

1. **Verify return code**: Should be `0 (ok)` if the certificate validates properly
2. **Protocol version**: Should be TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 for modern security
3. **Cipher**: Should use modern algorithms (ECDHE, AES-GCM, ChaCha20)
4. **Handshake**: Check for successful completion
5. **Certificate chain**: Verify all certificates in the chain are present

Example of a secure connection:

```text
Protocol: TLSv1.3
Cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
Verification: OK
Secure Renegotiation: supported
Server Temp Key: X25519, 253 bits
```

## Advanced Operations

### Creating OCSP Requests

```bash
# Generate an OCSP request
openssl ocsp -issuer ca.crt -cert certificate.crt -reqout ocsp_request.der

# Send an OCSP request to a responder
openssl ocsp -issuer ca.crt -cert certificate.crt -url http://ocsp.example.com -resp_text
```

### Working with Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)

```bash
# Generate a CRL
openssl ca -gencrl -out crl.pem -config ca.conf

# View CRL information
openssl crl -in crl.pem -text -noout

# Verify a certificate against a CRL
openssl verify -crl_check -CAfile ca.crt -CRLfile crl.pem certificate.crt
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Test RSA signing performance
openssl speed rsa

# Test symmetric cipher performance
openssl speed aes-256-cbc

# Test hash function performance
openssl speed sha256
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Certificate Verification Failure

```bash
# Check the entire certificate chain
openssl verify -verbose -CAfile ca_bundle.crt certificate.crt

# Inspect certificate information for errors
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout
```

#### Issue: Private Key Does Not Match Certificate

```bash
# Compare certificate and key modulus
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificate.crt | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in private.key | openssl md5
```

#### Issue: Name Constraints Violation

```bash
# Check certificate policies and constraints
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout | grep -A10 "X509v3 Name Constraints"
```

### Debugging SSL/TLS Connections

```bash
# Enable full debugging output
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -debug

# Check handshake process
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -state

# Check TLS protocol version and cipher
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tlsextdebug
```

## Security Considerations

When working with OpenSSL and cryptographic operations, several security considerations should be kept in mind to avoid common pitfalls.

### Known Vulnerabilities

OpenSSL has experienced several high-profile vulnerabilities. Awareness of these helps prevent security issues:

| Vulnerability | Affected Versions | Description | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) | 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f | Allows attackers to read memory from the server, potentially exposing private keys | Upgrade to 1.0.1g+ or 1.1.0+ |
| POODLE (CVE-2014-3566) | All versions supporting SSLv3 | Padding Oracle attack allowing decryption of secure communications | Disable SSLv3 support |
| FREAK (CVE-2015-0204) | Versions before 1.0.1k | Allows forced use of weak export-grade ciphers | Upgrade to 1.0.1k+ or 1.1.0+ |
| Logjam (CVE-2015-4000) | All versions with weak DH parameters | Downgrade attack allowing MITM attacks | Use 2048+ bit DH parameters |
| DROWN (CVE-2016-0800) | Versions supporting SSLv2 | Cross-protocol attack on TLS using SSLv2 | Disable SSLv2 support, upgrade to latest |

### Secure Configuration Principles

1. **Disable Legacy Protocols**: Explicitly disable SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1.0, and TLSv1.1 in production environments
2. **Use Strong Ciphers Only**: Configure cipher suites to include only strong algorithms
3. **Implement Forward Secrecy**: Prioritize ECDHE and DHE cipher suites
4. **Secure Renegotiation**: Ensure only secure renegotiation is allowed
5. **OCSP Stapling**: Enable OCSP stapling to enhance certificate validation privacy

### Common Security Mistakes

1. **Weak Key Generation**: Using insufficient key sizes (less than 2048-bit RSA or 256-bit ECC)
2. **Self-signed in Production**: Using self-signed certificates in production environments
3. **Private Key Exposure**: Inadequate protection of private keys, including:
   - Insufficient file permissions
   - Unencrypted private keys
   - Storing keys in insecure locations
   - Including private keys in backups or repositories
4. **Failure to Validate**: Not properly validating certificate chains
5. **Certificate Lifespans**: Using excessively long validity periods for certificates
6. **Ignoring Expiration**: Not monitoring certificate expiration dates
7. **Weak Random Number Generation**: Not ensuring sufficient entropy for key generation

### Security-Focused Commands

```bash
# Generate a secure 4096-bit RSA key with strong encryption
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out secure_key.pem 4096

# Verify proper permissions on a key file
ls -la secure_key.pem
chmod 600 secure_key.pem

# Check OpenSSL PRNG state
openssl rand -writerand .rnd

# Verify a certificate hasn't been revoked (OCSP)
openssl ocsp -issuer ca.crt -cert cert.crt -text -url http://ocsp.example.com/

# Verify a certificate with CRL checking
openssl verify -crl_check -CAfile ca.crt -CRLfile revoked.crl cert.crt

# Create secure Diffie-Hellman parameters (2048+ bits)
openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 2048
```

## Best Practices

### Key and Certificate Management

1. **Use Strong Keys**:  
   - RSA: Minimum 2048-bit, prefer 4096-bit for CAs and high-security applications
   - ECC: Minimum 256-bit curves (P-256/secp256r1 or better)
   - EdDSA: Ed25519 for modern applications requiring high performance

2. **Protect Private Keys**:
   - Always use strong password encryption for private keys (`-aes256` option)
   - Set restrictive file permissions: `chmod 600 private.key`
   - Consider hardware security modules (HSMs) for high-security environments
   - Never store private keys in public repositories or unsecured backups

3. **Certificate Chain Validation**:
   - Always include the complete certificate chain in server configurations
   - Verify chain validity with `openssl verify -CAfile chain.pem cert.crt`
   - Include intermediate certificates when distributing end-entity certificates

4. **Certificate Lifecycle Management**:
   - Implement automated certificate monitoring and renewal processes
   - Set reasonable validity periods (90-398 days for public TLS certificates)
   - Maintain a certificate inventory with expiration dates and renewal procedures
   - Establish a documented revocation process

5. **Naming and Organization**:
   - Use consistent, descriptive naming conventions for all files
   - Organize certificates in a structured directory hierarchy
   - Document certificate usage, ownership, and management responsibilities

### Implementation Best Practices

1. **Version Management**:
   - Stay current with the latest stable OpenSSL versions
   - Subscribe to security announcements via [openssl-announce](https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-announce)
   - Regularly check for security patches

2. **Configuration Security**:
   - Use secure default configurations
   - Disable legacy protocols (SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1)
   - Prioritize forward secrecy cipher suites
   - Configure secure cipher ordering with modern algorithms

3. **Automation and Infrastructure**:
   - Use configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) for consistent deployment
   - Implement certificate automation with tools like Certbot, cert-manager, or ACME clients
   - Integrate certificate lifecycle management into CI/CD pipelines
   - Consider certificate management services for enterprise environments

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Regularly scan for expiring certificates
   - Perform periodic security testing of TLS configurations
   - Use tools like [SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to validate configurations
   - Implement automated testing in pre-production environments

5. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Maintain secure backups of CA certificates and private keys
   - Document recovery procedures for compromised keys
   - Create and test certificate revocation procedures
   - Establish alternate validation methods in case of CA failure

### Documentation Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Records**:
   - Maintain an inventory of all certificates with metadata
   - Document procedures for certificate request, issuance, and renewal
   - Keep records of certificate parameters, including key sizes and algorithms

2. **Process Documentation**:
   - Create clear documentation for certificate operations
   - Include step-by-step guides for common certificate tasks
   - Document emergency procedures for certificate compromise
