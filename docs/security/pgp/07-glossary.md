## PGP/GPG Glossary

This comprehensive glossary defines key terms, concepts, and terminology related to PGP/GPG encryption and cryptography.

## Core PGP/GPG Terms

**Algorithm**
: A mathematical procedure used for encryption, decryption, digital signing, or key generation. Common PGP algorithms include RSA, DSA, and AES.

**ASCII Armor**
: A method of encoding binary PGP data into printable ASCII text format, making it safe for transmission through email and other text-based systems. Armored data is enclosed in `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----` and `-----END PGP MESSAGE-----` blocks.

**Asymmetric Cryptography**
: A cryptographic system that uses two mathematically related but different keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption. Also known as public-key cryptography.

**Certificate**
: In PGP context, synonymous with a public key. Contains the public key, user identification information, and digital signatures that validate the key's authenticity.

**Cipher**
: An algorithm for performing encryption and decryption. Examples include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard).

**Ciphertext**
: Data that has been encrypted and is unreadable without the proper decryption key. The output of an encryption operation on plaintext.

**Digital Signature**
: A cryptographic mechanism that provides authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. Created by encrypting a message hash with the sender's private key.

**Encryption**
: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm and key, making the data unreadable to unauthorized parties.

**Fingerprint**
: A short, unique identifier derived from a public key, typically displayed as a hexadecimal string. Used to verify key authenticity and prevent key substitution attacks.

**GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)**
: A free, open-source implementation of the OpenPGP standard. The most widely used PGP-compatible software, available for multiple operating systems.

**Hash Function**
: A mathematical function that takes input data of any size and produces a fixed-size output (hash). Used in digital signatures and integrity verification. Common hash functions include SHA-256 and SHA-512.

**Key ID**
: A shorter identifier derived from a public key, used to reference specific keys. Can be 8-character (short) or 16-character (long) hexadecimal strings.

**Key Pair**
: A matched set of cryptographic keys consisting of one public key and one private key, mathematically related but computationally distinct.

**Key Server**
: A publicly accessible repository for storing and distributing PGP public keys. Examples include keys.openpgp.org and keyserver.ubuntu.com.

**Keyring**
: A collection of PGP keys stored together, typically referring to either a public keyring (containing public keys) or a secret keyring (containing private keys).

**OpenPGP**
: The open standard for PGP encryption defined in RFC 4880. Ensures interoperability between different PGP implementations.

**Passphrase**
: A secret phrase used to protect a private key. Similar to a password but typically longer and may include spaces and special characters.

**PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**
: The original encryption software created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991. Now refers to the general family of PGP-compatible encryption software.

**Plaintext**
: Unencrypted, readable data. The input to an encryption operation or the output of a decryption operation.

**Private Key**
: The secret component of a key pair, used for decrypting messages sent to you and for creating digital signatures. Must be kept confidential and protected with a strong passphrase.

**Public Key**
: The non-secret component of a key pair, used for encrypting messages to send to the key owner and for verifying digital signatures. Can be freely distributed.

**Revocation Certificate**
: A special certificate that invalidates a key pair, typically used when a private key is compromised or no longer needed.

**Subkey**
: Additional keys associated with a master key, typically used for specific purposes like encryption or signing while keeping the master key secure.

**Symmetric Cryptography**
: A cryptographic system where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Faster than asymmetric cryptography but requires secure key distribution.

**Trust Level**
: A measure of confidence in a key's authenticity, ranging from unknown to ultimate trust. Affects whether you consider signatures from that key to be valid.

**User ID (UID)**
: Information associated with a PGP key that identifies the key owner, typically including name and email address.
