## [GPG (Redhat/CentOS)](#tab/redhatcentos)

Installing just GnuPG.

```bash
sudo yum install gnupg
```
## [GPG (Debian/Ubuntu)](#tab/debianubuntu)

Installing just GnuPG.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gnupg
```
## [GnuPG/Gnu Privacy Assistant (Linux)](#tab/linux)

Installing GnuPG with Gnu Privacy Assistant. I like GPA as a graphical front-end because its layout is really easy to understand and follow.

1. Open a Terminal
2. Enter the following command and press **Enter**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gpa gnupg2
    ```
3. Enter your sudo password, hit **Enter**
4. This will install all dependancies needed for both to work properly, tell you the space needed, and ask you to confirm. Type **Y** then press **Enter** to confirm
5. Wait while everything installs

This should only take a few minutes to complete. See this picture to confirm you're doing the steps correctly:
