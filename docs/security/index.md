This section covers a range of security topics including encryption, secure communications, open source intelligence (OSINT), and wireless security.

## Topics

- [SSH](ssh/index.md) - Secure Shell configuration and best practices
- [Certificates](certificates/index.md) - Certificate management and PKI fundamentals
- [OSINT](osint/index.md) - Open Source Intelligence techniques and tools
- [PGP Encryption](pgp/index.md) - Secure communications with Pretty Good Privacy
- [Wireless Security](wireless/index.md) - Security practices for wireless networks

## Getting Started

### Security Fundamentals

Understanding these core security principles will help you build a strong foundation:

1. **CIA Triad**:
   - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to authorized users
   - **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of data
   - **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed

2. **Defense in Depth**: Implementing multiple layers of security controls

3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Providing users with minimal access rights needed for their job functions

### Essential Security Practices

#### 1. Secure Communications

For encrypted communications with PGP:

```bash
# Generate a new PGP key pair
gpg --full-generate-key

# Export your public key to share with others
gpg --export --armor your@email.com > public_key.asc

# Encrypt a file for a recipient
gpg --encrypt --recipient recipient@email.com file.txt
```

See the [PGP guide](pgp/index.md) for more detailed instructions.

#### 2. Secure Remote Access

Set up SSH with key-based authentication:

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Copy public key to remote server
ssh-copy-id user@remote-server

# Connect to remote server securely
ssh user@remote-server
```

See the [SSH documentation](ssh/index.md) for advanced configurations.

#### 3. Information Gathering

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques:

```bash
# Use whois for domain information
whois example.com

# DNS information gathering
dig example.com ANY
```

Explore more in the [OSINT section](osint/index.md).

### Next Steps

- Learn about [encryption algorithms and their applications](pgp/05-encryption.md)
- Explore [SSH hardening techniques](ssh/index.md) for server security
- Understand [wireless security protocols](wireless/index.md) and vulnerabilities
