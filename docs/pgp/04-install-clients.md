## [GnuPG/Gnu Privacy Assistant (Linux)](#tab/linux)

Like I said in the intro, we&#39;ll be using GnuPG with Gnu Privacy Assistant. I like GPA as a graphical front-end because its layout is really easy to understand and follow.

1. Open up Terminal
2. Type, without quotes, &#39;sudo apt-get install gpa gnupg2&#39;, then hit &#39;enter&#39;
3. Enter your password, hit &#39;enter&#39;
4. It will pull the dependancies needed for both to work properly, tell you the space needed, and ask you to confirm. Type &#39;y&#39; then hit &#39;enter&#39; to confirm
5. Wait a bit as everything installs

This should only take a few minutes to complete. See this picture to confirm you&#39;re doing the steps correctly:
