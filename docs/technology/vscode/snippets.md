# Snippets

Snippets are a way to save templates for pieces of code that you use often. It can be a complex one-liner or an entire function.

The snippets are saved in VS Code and can be inserted by pressing ```Ctrl + .``` and selecting the appropriate option from the list. You can filter the list of snippets by typing the name of the snippet you wish to use. 

## Knowledgebase Articles

The following snippets are templaces for knowledgebase articles in Markdown. There are four types of articles listed:

- Troubleshooting
- Service Description
- Process
- Frequently Asked Questions

```json
{
    // Place your snippets for markdown here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
    // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
    // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
    // same ids are connected.
    // Example:
    // "Print to console": {
    //  "prefix": "log",
    //  "body": [
    //      "console.log('$1');",
    //      "$2"
    //  ],
    //  "description": "Log output to console"
    // }
