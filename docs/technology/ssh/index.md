Secure Shell Protocol, or SSH, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to securly access a remote system for tasks such as adminstration and file copy.

SSH was created to replace insecure administrative protocols like telnet. SSH uses cryptographic techniques to autheticate users and ensure that communications between hosts are encrypted. User authentication in SSH can be performed using username and password or cryptographic key pairs.

## Uses for SSH
