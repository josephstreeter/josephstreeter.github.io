# Data Types

## String

## Numeric Type

A numeric type is one that allows representation of integer or fractional values, and that supports arithmetic operations on those values. The set of numerical types includes the integer and real number types, but does not include bool or char.

### Integer

Other integer types are SByte, Int16, UInt16, UInt32, and UInt64, all in the namespace System.

### Long

### Bool

### Decimal

### Single

### Double

## DateTime

## XML

## Collections

Many collection classes are defined as part of the System.Collections or System.Collections.Generic namespaces. Most collection classes implement the interfaces ICollection, IComparer, IEnumerable, IList, IDictionary, and IDictionaryEnumerator and their generic equivalents.

### Arrays

#### Array List

#### Generic List

### Hashtable
