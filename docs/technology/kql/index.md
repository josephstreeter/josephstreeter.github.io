Kusto Query Language (KQL) is used to explore data and discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, create statistical modeling, and more. KQL is a simple yet powerful language to query structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. The language is expressive, easy to read and understand the query intent, and optimized for authoring experiences. Kusto Query Language is optimal for querying telemetry, metrics, and logs with deep support for text search and parsing, time-series operators and functions, analytics and aggregation, geospatial, vector similarity searches, and many other language constructs that provide optimal data analysis capabilities. The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to SQL: databases, tables, and columns.

## Microsoft Services Using KQL

- Azure Monitor
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced Hunting
- Azure Data Explorer
- Application Insights

## Kusto Queries

A Kusto query is a read-only request to process data and return results. The request is stated in plain text, using a data-flow model that is easy to read, author, and automate. Kusto queries are made of one or more query statements.

## Query Statements

There are three types of user query statements:

- **Tabular** - Both the input and output are made of tables or tabular data. The tabular statements consist of tabular input and tabular output and may have operators. As the data is piped (`|`) from one operator to another it is filtered, rearranged, or summarized.
- **Let** - A let statement is used to set a variable name equal to an expression or a function, or to create views. let statements are useful for:
  - Breaking up a complex expression into multiple parts, each represented by a variable.
  - Defining constants outside of the query body for readability.
  - Defining a variable once and using it multiple times within a query.
- **Set** - Not actually part of the Kusto Query Language. It is used to set a request property for the duration of the query.

> [!NOTE]
> The pipe operator (`|`) is fundamental to KQL queries and allows you to chain operations together in a readable, left-to-right flow.

## Common KQL Operators and Functions

### Parse JSON into Columns

The `parse_json()` function is used to extract values from JSON strings. Here's how to parse authentication details:

```kql
extend SPF_ = parse_json(AuthenticationDetails).SPF
```

**Example - Extracting email authentication details:**

```kql
EmailEvents
| where RecipientEmailAddress endswith "gmail.com"
| extend SPF_ = parse_json(AuthenticationDetails).SPF
| extend DKIM_ = parse_json(AuthenticationDetails).DKIM
| extend DMARC_ = parse_json(AuthenticationDetails).DMARC
| project Timestamp, RecipientEmailAddress, SenderFromAddress, SenderIPv4, SenderIPv6, SPF_, DMARC_, DKIM_, LatestDeliveryAction
```

> [!TIP]
> Use the `parse_json()` function when working with JSON data stored in string columns. This is common in log data from various Microsoft services.

### mv-expand Operator

The `mv-expand` operator expands multi-value dynamic arrays or property bags into multiple records.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `mv-expand` operator is essential when working with arrays in KQL. It transforms one row with an array into multiple rows, one for each array element.

## Examples

### Azure Log Analytics Workspaces

> [!WARNING]
> The following examples contain sample data and should be adapted to your specific environment. Always test queries in a safe environment before using in production.

#### Bad Actor Hunting

This query takes a list of known bad actors and searches for other sign-ins from the same IP addresses.

```kql
let UPNs = dynamic(['hmitchell2@domain.com',
'rrueth@domain.com',
'ebendel@domain.com',
'nmarzette@domain.com',
'againes4@domain.com',
'apage5@domain.com',
'thazelwood@domain.com',
'whelms@domain.com',
'lmalaluan@domain.com']);
let KBAs = SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
| where UserPrincipalName in (UPNs)
| extend city_ = tostring(LocationDetails.city)
| extend countryOrRegion_ = tostring(LocationDetails.countryOrRegion)
| extend state_ = tostring(LocationDetails.state)
| extend browser_ = tostring(DeviceDetail.browser)
| extend operatingSystem_ = tostring(DeviceDetail.operatingSystem)
| project
    TimeGenerated,
    UserDisplayName,
    UserPrincipalName,
    IPAddress,
    AppDisplayName,
    countryOrRegion_,
    state_,
    city_,
    ResultDescription;
let IPs = KBAs | distinct IPAddress;
let PBAs = SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
| where IPAddress in (IPs)
| where UserPrincipalName !in (UPNs)
| extend city_ = tostring(LocationDetails.city)
| extend countryOrRegion_ = tostring(LocationDetails.countryOrRegion)
| extend state_ = tostring(LocationDetails.state)
| project
    TimeGenerated,
    UserDisplayName,
    UserPrincipalName,
    IPAddress,
    AppDisplayName,
    countryOrRegion_,
    state_,
    city_,
    ResultDescription;
KBAs | union PBAs
```

**Sample Output:**

| TimeGenerated [UTC] | UserDisplayName | UserPrincipalName | IPAddress | AppDisplayName | countryOrRegion_ | state_ | city_ | ResultDescription |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|------------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| 8/31/2024, 9:34:27.381 PM | againes4 | `againes4@domain.com` | 99.52.120.123 | AddName | US | Wisconsin | Racine | Invalid username or password or Invalid on-premise username or password. |

| 9/1/2024, 4:44:31.101 AM | thazelwood | `thazelwood@domain.com` | 99.52.120.123 | AddName | US | Wisconsin | Racine | |
| 8/31/2024, 3:40:36.456 PM | hmitchell2 | `hmitchell2@domain.com` | 2600:1702:e60:3850:85cf:cd6d:cb5e:a669 | AddName | US | Wisconsin | Milwaukee | |

#### Additional Security Queries

**All Sign-ins from IPs used by known bad actors:**

```kql
let IPAddresses = SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where UserPrincipalName in ("user1@domain.com",
"user2@domain.com",
"user3@domain.com",
"user4@domain.com")
| distinct IPAddress;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where IPAddress in (IPAddresses)
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, AppDisplayName, LocationDetails, ResultDescription
| order by UserPrincipalName
| distinct UserPrincipalName
```

**Users that have signed in from multiple countries in the defined timeframe:**

```kql
SigninLogs
| where tostring(LocationDetails["countryOrRegion"]) != "US"
| where tostring(LocationDetails["countryOrRegion"]) != ""
| where not(isnull(UserPrincipalName)) and UserPrincipalName != "Unknown"
| summarize UniqueUsers = make_set(UserPrincipalName) by IPAddress, OffendingCountry = tostring(LocationDetails["countryOrRegion"])
| where array_length(UniqueUsers) > 1
| project IPAddress, UniqueUsers, OffendingCountry
| sort by OffendingCountry asc
```

### Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced Hunting

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced Hunting uses KQL to query security data across endpoints, email, identities, and cloud apps.

#### Email Security Queries

**All messages sent to a specific email address:**

```kql
EmailEvents
| where SenderMailFromAddress endswith "edu-noreply@github.com"
| project Timestamp, SenderFromAddress, SenderMailFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject
| distinct RecipientEmailAddress
```

**Users sending more than 700 messages in one day:**

```kql
EmailEvents
| where EmailDirection == "Outbound"
| where SenderFromAddress !startswith "mailer"
| project Timestamp, SenderFromAddress, SenderMailFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject
| summarize count_ = count() by bin(Timestamp, 1d), SenderFromAddress
| where count_ >= 700
```

**Number of messages sent by a user:**

```kql
EmailEvents
| where RecipientEmailAddress == "salewis1@domain.com"
| summarize count_ = count() by SenderMailFromAddress
| order by count_
```

**Messages sent by a list of users:**

```kql
EmailEvents
| where RecipientEmailAddress in ("user1@domain.com",
"user2@domain.com",
"user3@domain.com",
"user4@domain.com")
| project Timestamp, SenderMailFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, LatestDeliveryLocation, LatestDeliveryAction
```

**All Spam and Phishing Messages sent to a list of users:**

| where ThreatTypes == @"Phish, Spam"
```

#### Authentication Security Queries

**AiTM (Adversary-in-the-Middle) Attack Detection:**

> [!CAUTION]
> This query is designed to detect potential adversary-in-the-middle attacks by identifying sessions where users access different applications from different countries within the same session.

```kql
let OfficeHomeSessionIds = 
AADSignInEventsBeta
| where Timestamp > ago(1d)
| where ErrorCode == 0
| where ApplicationId == "4765445b-32c6-49b0-83e6-1d93765276ca" //OfficeHome application 
| where ClientAppUsed == "Browser" 
| where LogonType has "interactiveUser" 
| summarize arg_min(Timestamp, Country) by SessionId;
AADSignInEventsBeta
| where Timestamp > ago(1d)
| where ApplicationId != "4765445b-32c6-49b0-83e6-1d93765276ca"
| where ClientAppUsed == "Browser"
