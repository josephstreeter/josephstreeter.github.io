Security hardening guidelines and protection measures for BIND9 DNS server environments.

## 🛡️ Security Configuration

### Access Control

```bash
# Configure access control lists
acl "trusted" {
    192.168.1.0/24;
    127.0.0.1;
};

options {
    recursion yes;
    allow-recursion { trusted; };
    allow-transfer { none; };
    allow-update { none; };
};
```

### Rate Limiting

```bash
# Configure response rate limiting
options {
    rate-limit {
        responses-per-second 10;
        window 5;
    };
};
```

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Implement strict access controls and rate limiting to protect against DNS abuse and attacks.

*Proper security hardening protects BIND9 infrastructure from common DNS-based threats.*
