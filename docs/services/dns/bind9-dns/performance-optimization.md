Performance optimization techniques and tuning strategies for BIND9 DNS server environments.

## âš¡ Performance Tuning

### Cache Optimization

```bash
# Configure cache settings
options {
    max-cache-size 512M;
    max-cache-ttl 86400;
    max-ncache-ttl 3600;
    cleaning-interval 60;
};
```

### Query Optimization

```bash
# Optimize query handling
options {
    recursive-clients 10000;
    tcp-clients 150;
    minimal-responses yes;
};
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Monitor cache hit ratios and adjust cache sizes based on query patterns and available memory.

*Performance optimization ensures efficient DNS query processing and optimal resource utilization.*
