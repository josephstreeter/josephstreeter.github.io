Comprehensive security guidelines and best practices for protecting DNS infrastructure.

## 🛡️ Security Framework

### DNSSEC Implementation

- **Zone Signing** - Cryptographic protection
- **Key Management** - Secure key storage and rotation
- **Validation** - Recursive resolver configuration
- **Monitoring** - DNSSEC health checks

### Access Control

```bash
# BIND9 ACL example
acl "internal" {
    192.168.0.0/16;
    10.0.0.0/8;
    172.16.0.0/12;
};

options {
    allow-recursion { internal; };
    allow-transfer { none; };
    allow-update { none; };
};
```

## 🔒 Protection Measures

### DDoS Mitigation

- **Rate Limiting** - Query rate restrictions
- **Response Rate Limiting** - Abuse prevention
- **Anycast Distribution** - Traffic distribution
- **Monitoring** - Attack detection and response

### Security Monitoring

```powershell
# Windows DNS security monitoring
Get-WinEvent -LogName "DNS Server" | Where-Object Id -eq 770
```

```bash
# BIND9 security monitoring
grep "security" /var/log/named/security.log
```

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Implement defense in depth with multiple security layers including DNSSEC, access controls, and monitoring.

*Comprehensive security measures protect DNS infrastructure from evolving cyber threats.*
