Disaster recovery planning and procedures for DNS infrastructure.

## ğŸš¨ Recovery Planning

### Backup Strategies

- **Zone File Backups** - Regular zone data backup
- **Configuration Backups** - Server configuration preservation
- **Database Backups** - Active Directory integrated zones
- **Automation** - Scheduled backup procedures

### Recovery Procedures

```powershell
# Windows DNS backup
Export-DnsServerZone -Name "contoso.com" -FileName "contoso.com.bak"

# Windows DNS restore
Import-DnsServerZone -Name "contoso.com" -FileName "contoso.com.bak"
```

```bash
# BIND9 backup
cp /etc/bind/zones/* /backup/dns/
tar -czf dns-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /etc/bind/

# BIND9 restore
tar -xzf dns-backup.tar.gz -C /
systemctl restart named
```

## ğŸ”„ Continuity Planning

### Failover Scenarios

- **Primary Server Failure** - Secondary server promotion
- **Site-Wide Outage** - Geographic failover
- **Data Corruption** - Point-in-time recovery
- **DDoS Attack** - Traffic redirection

### Testing Procedures

- **Regular DR Tests** - Quarterly recovery testing
- **Documentation Updates** - Procedure validation
- **Staff Training** - Recovery team preparation
- **Communication Plans** - Stakeholder notification
