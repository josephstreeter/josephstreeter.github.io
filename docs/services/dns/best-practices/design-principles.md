Fundamental design principles and architecture guidelines for enterprise DNS infrastructure.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Hierarchical Design

- **Authoritative Servers** - Master zone data
- **Recursive Resolvers** - Client query resolution
- **Caching Servers** - Performance optimization
- **Forwarders** - External resolution

### Redundancy Strategy

```text
DNS Architecture Example:

Primary DNS Server (192.168.1.10)
├── Authoritative for internal zones
├── Primary zone files
└── Zone transfer source

Secondary DNS Server (192.168.1.11)
├── Zone transfer destination
├── Backup resolution
└── Load distribution

External Forwarders
├── Public DNS resolvers
├── ISP DNS servers
└── Cloud DNS services
```

## 📋 Planning Guidelines

### Capacity Planning

- **Query Volume** - Estimate peak query rates
- **Zone Size** - Plan for record growth
- **Network Bandwidth** - Zone transfer requirements
- **Server Resources** - CPU, memory, storage

### Security Considerations

- **Zone Separation** - Internal vs external zones
- **Access Control** - Query and transfer restrictions
- **DNSSEC Implementation** - Data integrity protection
- **Monitoring** - Security event detection

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Design DNS infrastructure with geographic distribution and redundancy to ensure high availability and optimal performance.

*Sound design principles ensure scalable, reliable, and secure DNS infrastructure for enterprise environments.*
