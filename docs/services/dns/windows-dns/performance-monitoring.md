Performance monitoring and optimization strategies for Windows DNS Server environments.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Counters

```powershell
# Monitor DNS performance counters
Get-Counter "\DNS\Total Query Received/sec"
Get-Counter "\DNS\Total Response Sent/sec"
Get-Counter "\DNS\Recursive Queries/sec"
```

### Server Statistics

```powershell
# Get DNS server statistics
Get-DnsServerStatistics

# Monitor cache performance
Get-DnsServerCache
```

## âš¡ Performance Optimization

### Cache Configuration

```powershell
# Configure cache settings
Set-DnsServerCache -LockingPercent 90 -MaxKBSize 512000

# Clear cache if needed
Clear-DnsServerCache
```

### Monitoring Scripts

```powershell
# Performance monitoring script
$stats = Get-DnsServerStatistics
Write-Output "Queries received: $($stats.TotalQueriesReceived)"
Write-Output "Responses sent: $($stats.TotalResponsesSent)"
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Monitor DNS cache hit ratios and query response times to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

*Regular performance monitoring ensures optimal DNS service delivery and user experience.*
