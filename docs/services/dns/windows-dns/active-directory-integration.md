Windows DNS Server provides deep integration with Active Directory for enhanced security and functionality.

## 🔗 Active Directory Integration

### Benefits of AD Integration

- **Enhanced Security** - ACL-based security on DNS objects
- **Automatic Replication** - Multi-master replication through AD
- **Dynamic Updates** - Secure dynamic DNS updates
- **Site-Aware Replication** - Efficient replication topology

### Configuration

```powershell
# Convert zone to AD integrated
ConvertTo-DnsServerPrimaryZone -Name "contoso.com" -ReplicationScope "Domain"

# Configure secure dynamic updates
Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone -Name "contoso.com" -DynamicUpdate "Secure"
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Secure Dynamic Updates

```powershell
# Enable secure dynamic updates
Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone -Name "contoso.com" -DynamicUpdate "Secure"

# Configure client settings
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -ServerAddresses "192.168.1.10"
```

### Access Control

```powershell
# Configure zone-level permissions
$acl = Get-Acl "AD:\DC=contoso,DC=com,CN=MicrosoftDNS,DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=contoso,DC=com"
# Modify ACL as needed
```
