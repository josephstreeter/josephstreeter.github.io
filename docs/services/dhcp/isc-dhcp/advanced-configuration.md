Advanced configuration features for ISC DHCP Server including host reservations and client classes.

## ðŸ”’ Host Reservations

### Static IP Assignments

```bash
host server-01 {
    hardware ethernet 00:11:22:33:44:55;
    fixed-address 192.168.1.50;
    option host-name "server-01";
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ Client Classes

### Device Classification

```bash
class "printers" {
    match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 7) = "printer";
}

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    pool {
        allow members of "printers";
        range 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.60;
    }
}
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Use client classes to apply different configurations based on device types or organizational units.

*Advanced configuration features provide granular control over DHCP behavior and client management.*
