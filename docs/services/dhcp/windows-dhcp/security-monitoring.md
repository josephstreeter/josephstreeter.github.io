Securing and monitoring Windows DHCP Server is critical for network reliability and security.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Server Authorization

```powershell
# Verify DHCP server authorization
Get-DhcpServerInDC

# Authorize DHCP server
Add-DhcpServerInDC -DnsName "DHCP-Server01.contoso.com" -IPAddress 192.168.1.10
```

### Access Control

```powershell
# Configure security groups
Add-DhcpServerSecurityGroup

# Add administrators
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "DHCP Administrators" -Members "User1","User2"
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Logging

### Performance Monitoring

```powershell
# Get server statistics
Get-DhcpServerv4Statistics

# Monitor scope utilization
Get-DhcpServerv4ScopeStatistics | Where-Object {$_.PercentageInUse -gt 80}

# Check server health
Get-DhcpServerv4Binding
```

### Event Log Monitoring

```powershell
# Monitor DHCP events
Get-WinEvent -LogName "DhcpAdminEvents" -MaxEvents 50

# Check for errors
Get-WinEvent -LogName "DhcpAdminEvents" | Where-Object LevelDisplayName -eq "Error"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authorization Problems

```powershell
# Re-authorize server
Remove-DhcpServerInDC -DnsName "DHCP-Server01.contoso.com"
Add-DhcpServerInDC -DnsName "DHCP-Server01.contoso.com" -IPAddress 192.168.1.10
```

#### Service Issues

```powershell
# Restart DHCP service
Restart-Service DHCPServer

# Check service dependencies
Get-Service DHCPServer | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ServicesDependedOn
```

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Implement regular monitoring of DHCP scope utilization and set up alerts when scopes reach 80% capacity to prevent address exhaustion.

*Proper security and monitoring ensure reliable DHCP operations in enterprise environments.*
