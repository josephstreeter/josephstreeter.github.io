Performance optimization techniques and capacity planning for enterprise DHCP deployments.

## âš¡ Performance Tuning

### Lease Duration Optimization

- **Workstations**: 8-24 hours
- **Mobile devices**: 2-4 hours
- **Servers**: Static reservations
- **Guest networks**: 1-2 hours

### Database Optimization

```powershell
# Windows: Configure database settings
Set-DhcpServerDatabase -BackupInterval 60 -CleanupInterval 24
```

```bash
# ISC DHCP: Lease file management
# Regular lease file cleanup and rotation
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- Scope utilization percentage
- Lease assignment response time
- Database size and growth rate
- Network latency to DHCP relays

### Capacity Planning

- Monitor 80% utilization thresholds
- Plan for peak usage scenarios
- Implement proactive alerting

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Regular performance monitoring and proactive capacity planning prevent DHCP service degradation during peak usage periods.

*Optimized DHCP performance ensures reliable IP address assignment even under high load conditions.*
