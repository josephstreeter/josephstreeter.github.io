Essential security practices for protecting DHCP infrastructure from attacks and unauthorized access.

## 🛡️ Server Security

### Access Control

- Implement strict administrator access controls
- Use service accounts with minimal privileges
- Enable audit logging for all DHCP activities

### Network Security

- Deploy DHCP servers in secure network segments
- Implement firewall rules (UDP ports 67/68)
- Monitor for rogue DHCP servers

## 🔍 Monitoring and Detection

### Rogue DHCP Detection

```powershell
# Windows: Monitor for unauthorized DHCP servers
Get-DhcpServerInDC | Compare-Object $AuthorizedServers
```

```bash
# Linux: Scan for DHCP servers
nmap --script broadcast-dhcp-discover
```

### Security Auditing

- Regular security assessments
- Log analysis and monitoring
- Incident response procedures

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Implement network access control (NAC) to prevent unauthorized DHCP servers from disrupting network operations.

*Strong security practices protect DHCP infrastructure from common attacks and unauthorized access.*
