Comprehensive operational procedures for monitoring and maintaining enterprise DHCP infrastructure.

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Procedures

### Daily Monitoring Tasks

```powershell
# Windows DHCP monitoring
Get-DhcpServerv4Statistics
Get-DhcpServerv4ScopeStatistics | Where-Object {$_.PercentageInUse -gt 80}
```

```bash
# ISC DHCP monitoring
systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
dhcp-lease-list --lease /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases | wc -l
```

### Automated Alerting

- Scope utilization thresholds (80% warning, 95% critical)
- Service availability monitoring
- Database size and growth alerts
- Lease assignment failure rates

## ðŸ”§ Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

#### Weekly Tasks

- Review scope utilization reports
- Check service logs for errors
- Verify backup procedures
- Update documentation

#### Monthly Tasks

- Database cleanup and optimization
- Security audit and review
- Performance analysis
- Capacity planning review

### Backup and Recovery

```powershell
# Windows DHCP backup
Export-DhcpServer -File "C:\DHCP-Backup\DHCPBackup.xml"
```

```bash
# ISC DHCP backup
cp /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf /backup/dhcpd.conf.$(date +%Y%m%d)
cp /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases /backup/dhcpd.leases.$(date +%Y%m%d)
```
