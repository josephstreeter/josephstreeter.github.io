Fundamental design principles for planning and implementing enterprise DHCP infrastructure.

## 🏗️ Network Architecture

### Hierarchical Design

- **Core DHCP Servers** - Centralized management
- **Distribution Layer** - Regional DHCP relays
- **Access Layer** - Client subnets

### Redundancy Planning

- **Primary/Secondary Servers** - High availability
- **Failover Configuration** - Automatic failover
- **Geographic Distribution** - Disaster recovery

## 📊 Capacity Planning

### Address Space Management

```text
Network: 192.168.0.0/16 (65,536 addresses)
├── Management: 192.168.0.0/24 (254 hosts)
├── Servers: 192.168.1.0/24 (254 hosts)
├── Workstations: 192.168.10.0/20 (4,094 hosts)
└── Guest: 192.168.100.0/24 (254 hosts)
```

### Growth Considerations

- Plan for 50-100% growth capacity
- Monitor utilization thresholds (80% alert)
- Implement address reclamation policies
