# Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 Synchronization Service

Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) 2016 Synchronization Service is a powerful identity synchronization platform that enables organizations to manage and synchronize identity data across multiple disparate systems. This document provides a comprehensive high-level overview of the service, its architecture, capabilities, and use cases.

## What is MIM 2016 Synchronization Service?

The **Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 Synchronization Service** (formerly known as Forefront Identity Manager or FIM Synchronization Service) is the core synchronization engine within the MIM suite. It serves as a central hub for identity data synchronization, enabling organizations to:

- **Synchronize identities** across multiple connected data sources
- **Transform and map** identity attributes between different systems
- **Maintain data consistency** across heterogeneous environments
- **Automate identity lifecycle management** processes
- **Enforce business rules** through custom logic and workflows

> [!NOTE]
> The Synchronization Service can operate independently of the MIM Service and Portal, making it a lightweight solution for pure synchronization scenarios.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

The MIM 2016 Synchronization Service consists of several key components that work together to provide comprehensive identity synchronization capabilities:

#### 1. Synchronization Engine

The **Synchronization Engine** is the heart of the service, responsible for:

- **Data processing**: Reading, transforming, and writing identity data
- **Rule evaluation**: Applying synchronization rules and business logic
- **Conflict resolution**: Handling data conflicts and inconsistencies
- **Change tracking**: Monitoring and processing data changes
- **Workflow orchestration**: Coordinating synchronization operations

#### 2. Metaverse

The **Metaverse** serves as the authoritative identity store within MIM:

- **Central repository**: Stores the unified view of each identity
- **Schema definition**: Defines the structure and attributes of identity objects
- **Relationship management**: Maintains connections between related objects
- **Data consolidation**: Combines data from multiple connected systems
- **Authoritative source**: Provides the single source of truth for identities

#### 3. Connector Space

**Connector Spaces** represent the staging areas for connected data sources:

- **Data staging**: Temporarily stores data from connected systems
- **Change detection**: Identifies modifications in source systems
- **Transformation preparation**: Prepares data for processing rules
- **Isolation**: Keeps each system's data separate during processing
- **Synchronization coordination**: Manages the flow of data to/from systems

#### 4. Management Agents (MAs)

**Management Agents** are the connectors that interface with external systems:

- **Data source connectivity**: Establish connections to various systems
- **Protocol support**: Handle different communication protocols and formats
- **Import/Export operations**: Facilitate data transfer operations
- **Change detection**: Monitor source systems for modifications
- **Error handling**: Manage connectivity and data processing errors
