This section provides security cleanup procedures and hardening guides for Active Directory environments, focusing on vulnerability remediation, security baseline implementation, and ongoing security maintenance.

## Available Guides

### Security Cleanup Procedures

- **[Security Cleanup Outline](outline.md)** - Comprehensive security cleanup procedure outline and checklist

## Security Cleanup Overview

Security cleanup for Active Directory involves systematic identification and remediation of security vulnerabilities, implementation of security baselines, and establishment of ongoing security maintenance procedures. This process is critical for maintaining a secure and compliant Active Directory environment.

### Key Security Areas

**Account Security:**

- Privileged account review and cleanup
- Inactive account identification and management
- Service account security validation
- Password policy compliance verification

**Permission Management:**

- Excessive privilege identification and remediation
- Administrative delegation review
- Group membership cleanup and validation
- ACL (Access Control List) optimization

**Configuration Hardening:**

- Security baseline implementation
- Default configuration remediation
- Protocol security enforcement
- Authentication mechanism hardening

## Security Assessment Phase

### Initial Security Assessment

**Vulnerability Identification:**

- Automated security scanning
- Manual configuration review
- Privilege escalation pathway analysis
- Compliance gap identification

**Risk Prioritization:**

- Critical vulnerability assessment
- Business impact evaluation
- Remediation complexity analysis
- Resource requirement planning

### Documentation and Planning

**Current State Documentation:**

- Security configuration inventory
- Permission structure mapping
- Account privilege documentation
- Compliance status assessment

**Remediation Planning:**

- Priority-based remediation roadmap
- Resource allocation planning
- Timeline development
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Cleanup Implementation

### Account Cleanup Procedures

**Privileged Account Review:**

- Domain Administrator membership audit
- Enterprise Administrator access validation
- Schema Administrator privilege review
- Custom privileged group assessment

**Service Account Security:**

- Service account inventory and validation
- Password management implementation
- Principle of least privilege enforcement
- Managed service account migration

**Inactive Account Management:**

- Stale account identification
- Cleanup procedure implementation
- Account archival processes
- Monitoring and alerting setup

### Permission Remediation

**Administrative Delegation:**

- Current delegation model review
- Excessive privilege identification
- Role-based access implementation
- Delegation documentation update

**Group Management:**

- Nested group optimization
- Universal group usage review
- Security group cleanup
- Distribution group validation

### Configuration Hardening

**Security Baseline Implementation:**

- CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmark application
- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) framework alignment
- Organization-specific security policy enforcement
- Industry compliance requirement implementation

**Protocol Security:**

- Legacy protocol disablement
- Secure authentication enforcement
- Encryption requirement implementation
- Certificate-based authentication setup

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Regular Security Reviews

**Monthly Reviews:**

- Privileged account access validation
- New account creation review
- Permission change auditing
- Security event log analysis

**Quarterly Assessments:**

- Comprehensive security posture review
- Compliance status validation
- Vulnerability assessment updates
- Security baseline compliance verification

### Automated Monitoring

**Security Monitoring Implementation:**

- Privileged account activity monitoring
- Unusual access pattern detection
- Configuration change tracking
- Compliance deviation alerting

**Reporting and Metrics:**

- Security posture dashboards
- Compliance status reporting
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Executive security summaries

## Compliance and Governance

### Regulatory Compliance

**Common Frameworks:**

- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley)** - Financial reporting controls
- **HIPAA** - Healthcare information protection
- **PCI DSS** - Payment card industry standards
- **GDPR** - General Data Protection Regulation

**Compliance Implementation:**

- Control mapping and implementation

- Approval workflow implementation
- Post-change validation procedures

## Tools and Automation

### Security Assessment Tools

**Microsoft Tools:**

- **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA)**
- **Active Directory Administrative Center**
- **Group Policy Management Console**
- **Active Directory Users and Computers**

**Third-Party Solutions:**

- **Netwrix Auditor** - Comprehensive AD auditing

- Compliance monitoring
- Alert generation and distribution

## Best Practices

### Security Cleanup Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Planning** - Develop detailed cleanup plans before implementation
2. **Phased Approach** - Implement changes in controlled phases
3. **Testing and Validation** - Test all changes in non-production environments
4. **Documentation** - Maintain detailed documentation of all changes
5. **Rollback Planning** - Prepare rollback procedures for all changes

### Ongoing Security Management

1. **Regular Reviews** - Schedule and perform regular security reviews
2. **Continuous Monitoring** - Implement continuous security monitoring
3. **Training and Awareness** - Provide ongoing security training
4. **Incident Response** - Maintain and test incident response procedures
5. **Vendor Management** - Regularly assess third-party security tools

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Identification:**

- Threat landscape analysis
- Vulnerability impact assessment
- Business continuity considerations
- Regulatory compliance risks

**Risk Mitigation:**

- Control implementation strategies
- Compensating control deployment
- Risk acceptance procedures
- Risk transfer mechanisms

### Business Continuity
