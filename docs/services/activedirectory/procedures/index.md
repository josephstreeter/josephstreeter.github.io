## Automation and Scripting

### PowerShell Automation

Many procedures can be automated using PowerShell scripts:

```powershell
# Example: Automated user account creation
$UserParams = @{
    Name = "John Doe"
    SamAccountName = "jdoe"
    UserPrincipalName = "jdoe@contoso.com"
    Path = "OU=Users,DC=contoso,DC=com"
    AccountPassword = (ConvertTo-SecureString "TempPass123!" -AsPlainText -Force)
    Enabled = $true
}
New-ADUser @UserParams
```

### Script Templates

Standardized script templates for common procedures:

- User provisioning scripts
- Bulk operations scripts
- Health check automation
- Maintenance task scripts
- Reporting and auditing scripts

## Change Management Integration

### Change Control Process

All procedures should follow organizational change management:

1. **Change Request Submission**
2. **Impact Assessment and Approval**
3. **Implementation Planning**
4. **Testing in Non-Production**
5. **Production Implementation**
6. **Post-Implementation Validation**
7. **Documentation Updates**

### Emergency Procedures
