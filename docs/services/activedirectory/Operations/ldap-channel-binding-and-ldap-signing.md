## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive information about implementing LDAP channel binding and signing security measures to protect Active Directory environments from elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. The security enhancements described here were mandated by Microsoft security updates beginning in 2020.

**Current Status (July 2025):** These security measures are now enabled by default on all supported Windows platforms. This guide helps administrators understand, verify, and troubleshoot these critical security features.

## Executive Summary

LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing provide essential security protections for communications between LDAP clients and Active Directory domain controllers. Without these protections, Active Directory environments are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and elevation of privilege exploits.

### Key Security Benefits

- **Prevention of man-in-the-middle attacks** on LDAP communications
- **Protection against authentication replay attacks**
- **Enhanced integrity verification** for LDAP binds
- **Compliance with modern security standards**

### Affected Systems

This security requirement applies to all Windows systems running LDAP services:

- Windows Server 2008 SP2 and later
- Windows 7 SP1 and later
- All Windows 10 versions
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)

## Security Vulnerability Background

### The Problem

[LDAP channel binding](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034879) and [LDAP signing](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/935834) provide ways to increase the security of network communications between an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or an Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) and its clients. A vulnerability in the default configuration for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) channel binding and LDAP signing may expose Active Directory domain controllers to elevation of privilege vulnerabilities.

Microsoft Security Advisory [ADV190023](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/ADV190023) addressed the issue by recommending that administrators enable LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing on Active Directory Domain Controllers.

### Attack Scenarios

When using default settings, an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows that could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to successfully forward an authentication request to a Windows LDAP server, such as a system running AD DS or AD LDS, which has not been configured to require signing or sealing on incoming connections.

**Key vulnerabilities include:**

- **Replay attacks:** Intruders can intercept authentication attempts and reuse tickets to impersonate legitimate users
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** Attackers can capture, modify, and forward packets between clients and servers
- **LDAP request forgery:** Compromised authentication can cause servers to make decisions based on forged requests

## Current Implementation Status

**As of 2025, these security measures are enabled by default** on all supported Windows platforms. The original timeline from 2019-2020 has been completed.

### Historical Timeline

| **Date** | **Event** | **Status** |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **August 13, 2019** | Microsoft Security Advisory ADV190023 published | ✅ Completed |
| **January 2020** | Security updates enabled LDAP channel binding and signing by default | ✅ Completed |
| **2020-2025** | Ongoing enforcement and compatibility updates | ✅ Current |

### Recommended Actions (Current)

For organizations running modern Windows environments:

1. **Verify current configuration** using the verification steps below
2. **Test applications** for compatibility with enhanced security
3. **Update legacy applications** that may not support secure LDAP binds
4. **Monitor event logs** for authentication issues

**Important:** Any OS version, application, or intermediate device that performs man-in-the-middle inspection of LDAP traffic may be impacted by these security enhancements.

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before implementing LDAP channel binding and signing, ensure:

1. **Domain functional level** is Windows Server 2008 or higher
2. **All domain controllers** are patched with the latest security updates
3. **Client systems** have compatible versions of Windows installed
4. **Applications** have been tested for LDAP authentication compatibility
5. **Backup and rollback plan** is in place

### Verification Steps

#### Check Current Configuration Status

**Using PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Check LDAP server signing requirements
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters" -Name "LDAPServerIntegrity" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Check LDAP channel binding enforcement
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters" -Name "LdapEnforceChannelBinding" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Check client-side LDAP signing
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ldap\Parameters" -Name "ldapclientintegrity" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**Expected Values:**

- `LDAPServerIntegrity`: **2** (Require signing)
- `LdapEnforceChannelBinding`: **1** or **2** (Enabled)
- `ldapclientintegrity`: **2** (Require signing)

#### Monitor Event Logs

Check the following event logs for LDAP authentication issues:

```powershell
# Check for unsigned LDAP bind attempts
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Directory Service'; ID=2887,2888,2889} -MaxEvents 50

# Check for channel binding failures
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; ID=1326} -MaxEvents 50
```

### Configuration Methods

#### Method 1: Group Policy (Recommended)

**Server-side LDAP Signing:**

1. Open **Group Policy Management Console**
2. Navigate to **Default Domain Controllers Policy**
3. Go to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Local Policies** > **Security Options**
4. Configure **Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements** to **Require signing**

**Client-side LDAP Signing:**

1. Navigate to **Default Domain Policy**
2. Go to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Local Policies** > **Security Options**
3. Configure **Network security: LDAP client signing requirements** to **Require signing**

#### Method 2: Registry Configuration

**⚠️ Important:** Always backup the registry before making changes.

**Server Configuration:**

```batch
# LDAP Server Integrity (Require signing)
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters" /v LDAPServerIntegrity /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f

# LDAP Channel Binding (Enabled when supported)
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters" /v LdapEnforceChannelBinding /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

**Client Configuration:**

```batch
# LDAP Client Integrity (Require signing)
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ldap\Parameters" /v ldapclientintegrity /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
```

### Testing and Validation

#### Test LDAP Connections

Use the **LDP.exe** tool to test LDAP authentication:

```cmd
ldp.exe
```

1. **Connection** > **Connect** (Server: DC name, Port: 389)
2. **Connection** > **Bind** (Simple bind with credentials)
3. Expected result: **Strong Authentication Required** error if configuration is correct

#### Verify Configuration with PowerShell

```powershell
# Test LDAP bind with different authentication methods
$ldapConnection = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry("LDAP://DC01.contoso.com")
$ldapConnection.AuthenticationType = [System.DirectoryServices.AuthenticationTypes]::Signing
try {
    $ldapConnection.RefreshCache()
    Write-Host "LDAP signing is working correctly" -ForegroundColor Green
} catch {
    Write-Host "LDAP signing configuration issue: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Failures

**Symptom:** Applications cannot authenticate to Active Directory

**Solutions:**

1. Check if applications support LDAP signing
2. Update application configurations for secure LDAP
3. Verify network connectivity and DNS resolution
4. Review event logs for specific error codes

### Legacy Application Compatibility

**Symptom:** Older applications fail after implementing LDAP security

**Solutions:**

1. **Gradual implementation:** Start with `LdapEnforceChannelBinding = 1` for compatibility
2. **Application updates:** Work with vendors for security-compliant versions
3. **SSL/TLS implementation:** Use LDAPS (port 636) instead of LDAP (port 389)
4. **Intermediate solutions:** Configure application-specific LDAP settings

### Event Log Analysis

**Event ID 2887:** Unsigned LDAP binds detected

- **Action:** Identify and update clients performing unsigned binds

**Event ID 2888:** Unsigned LDAP binds rejected

- **Action:** Verify all clients are properly configured

**Event ID 2889:** Detailed logging of unsigned bind attempts

- **Action:** Use for detailed troubleshooting of specific clients

## Frequently Asked Questions

[Why is there a delay between the release of the Security Advisory and the release of the security update for Windows which will set LDAP channel binding to a more secure default setting?](https://support.microsoft.com/index.md)

Based on feedback Microsoft received, customers preferred we release the update after the 2019 holidays. Many administrators restrict configuration changes during the holiday season. Administrators will also need time to test these configuration changes and adjust their environment as needed to support it. This release schedule is intended to provide lead-time to prepare for this change.

### Historical Security Advisory Summary

[LDAP channel binding](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034879/how-to-add-the-ldapenforcechannelbinding-registry-entry) and [LDAP signing](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/935834/how-to-enable-ldap-signing-in-windows-server-2008) provide ways to increase the security for communications between LDAP clients and Active Directory domain controllers. A set of unsafe default configurations for LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing exist on Active Directory Domain Controllers that let LDAP clients communicate with them without enforcing LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing. This can open Active directory domain controllers to elevation of privilege vulnerabilities.

This advisory addresses the issue by recommending a new set of safe default configurations for LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing on Active Directory Domain Controllers that supersedes the original unsafe configuration.

### Recommended Actions

In an upcoming release in early 2020, Microsoft will provide a Windows update that by default will change the LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing to more secure configurations. When the update is available, customers will be notified via a revision to this advisory. If you wish to be notified when the update is released, we recommend that you register for the security notifications mailer to be alerted of content changes to this advisory. See [Microsoft Technical Security Notifications](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948). In the meantime, we strongly advise customers to take the following steps at the earliest opportunity:

- Configure your systems to help make LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing on Active Directory Domain Controllers more secure.
- Find and fix any application compatibility issues in the environment.

See the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles for guidance on how to enable LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing on Active Directory Domain Controllers:

- [LDAP signing](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/935834/how-to-enable-ldap-signing-in-windows-server-2008)

### FAQ

**1. Why did Microsoft delay the release of the update which sets LDAP channel binding to a more secure default setting?**

Based on feedback Microsoft received, customers preferred that we release the update after the 2019 holiday season. Many administrators restrict configuration changes during the holiday season. Administrators will also need time to test these LDAP configuration changes and to adjust their environment as needed to support the changes. Releasing the update is intended to provide the lead-time needed to prepare for this change.

### RAPID PUBLISHING

RAPID PUBLISHING ARTICLES PROVIDE INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO EMERGING OR UNIQUE TOPICS AND MAY BE UPDATED AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

### INTRODUCTION

The security of a directory server can be significantly improved by configuring the server to reject Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) LDAP binds that do not request signing (integrity verification) or to reject LDAP simple binds that are performed on a clear text (non-SSL/TLS-encrypted) connection. SASLs may include protocols such as the Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, and Digest protocols.

Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to replay attacks in which an intruder intercepts the authentication attempt and the issuance of a ticket. The intruder can reuse the ticket to impersonate the legitimate user. Additionally, unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder captures packets between the client and the server, changes the packets, and then forwards them to the server. If this occurs on an LDAP server, an attacker can cause a server to make decisions that are based on forged requests from the LDAP client.

This article describes how to configure your directory server to protect it from such attacks.

### More Information

### How to discover clients that do not use the "Require signing" option

Clients that rely on unsigned SASL (Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, or Digest) LDAP binds or on LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection stop working after you make this configuration change. To help identify these clients, the directory server logs a summary event 2887 one time every 24 hours to indicate how many such binds occurred. We recommend that you configure these clients not to use such binds. After no such events are observed for an extended period, we recommend that you configure the server to reject such binds.

If you must have more information to identify such clients, you can configure the directory server to provide more detailed logs. This additional logging will log an event 2889 when a client tries to make an unsigned LDAP bind. The logging displays the IP address of the client and the identity that the client tried to use to authenticate. You can enable this additional logging by setting the **LDAP Interface Events** diagnostic setting to **2 (Basic)**. For more information about how to change the diagnostic settings, go to the following Microsoft website:

<http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9645087>

If the directory server is configured to reject unsigned SASL LDAP binds or LDAP simple binds over a non-SSL/TLS connection, the directory server will log a summary event 2888 one time every 24 hours when such bind attempts occur.

### Let me fix it myself

Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

[322756](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756) How to back up and restore the registry in Windows

- Click **Start**, click **Run**, type regedit, and then click **OK**.
- Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
    **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesNTDSParameters**

- Right-click the **LDAPServerIntegrity** registry entry, and then click **Modify**.
- Change **Value data** to 2, and then click **OK**.
- Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
    **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesldapParameters**

- Right-click the **ldapclientintegrity** registry entry, and then click **Modify**.
- Change the **Value data** to 2, and then click **OK**.

By default, for Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), the registry key is not available. Therefore, you must create a LDAPServerIntegrity registry entry of the REG_DWORD type under the following registry subkey:

```text
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServices<InstanceName>Parameters
```

Note The placeholder ```<InstanceName>``` represents the name of the AD LDS instance that you want to change.

**How to verify configuration changes

- Click **Start**, click **Run**, type ldp.exe, and then click **OK**.
- Under the **Connection** menu, click **Connect**.
- In the **Server** field and in the **Port** field, type the server name and the non-SSL/TLS port of your directory server, and then click **OK**.

    Note For an Active Directory Domain Controller, the applicable port is 389.

- After a connection is established, select **Bind** on the **Connection** menu.
- Under **Bind type**, select **Simple bind**.
- Type the user name and password, and then click **OK**.

if you receive the following error message, you successfully configured your directory server:

Ldap_simple_bind_s() failed: Strong Authentication Required
*From <<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/935834/how-to-enable-ldap-signing-in-windows-server-2008>>

**Use the LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry entry to make LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS more secure

Applies to: Windows Server 2016 Datacenter, Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2016 Standard [Additional Information](https://support.microsoft.com/index.md)

**Summary

[CVE-2017-8563](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-8563) introduces a registry setting that administrators can use to help make LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS more secure.

**More Information

**Important** This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

[322756](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756) How to back up and restore the registry in Windows

To help make LDAP authentication over SSLTLS more secure, administrators can configure the following registry settings:

- **Path for Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controllers:** HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetServicesNTDSParameters
- **Path for Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) servers:** HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\[LDS instance name]\Parameters
- **DWORD:** LdapEnforceChannelBinding
- **DWORD value: 0** indicates *disabled*. No channel binding validation is performed. This is the behavior of all servers that have not been updated.
- **DWORD value: 1** indicates *enabled*, when supported. All clients that are running on a version of Windows that has been updated to support channel binding tokens (CBT) must provide channel binding information to the server. Clients that are running a version of Windows that has not been updated to support CBT do not have to do so. This is an intermediate option that allows for application compatibility.
- **DWORD value: 2** indicates *enabled, always*. All clients must provide channel binding information. The server rejects authentication requests from clients that do not do so.

**Notes

- Before you enable this setting on a Domain Controller, clients must install the security update that is described in [CVE-2017-8563](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-8563). Otherwise, compatibility issues may arise, and LDAP authentication requests over SSL/TLS that previously worked may no longer work. By default, this setting is disabled.
- The LdapEnforceChannelBindings registry entry must be explicitly created.
- LDAP server responds dynamically to changes to this registry entry. Therefore, you do not have to restart the computer after you apply the registry change.

To maximize compatibility with older operating system versions (Windows Server 2008 and earlier versions), we recommend that you enable this setting with a value of **1**.

To explicitly disable the setting, set the LdapEnforceChannelBinding entry to **0** (zero).

Windows Server 2008 and older systems require that Microsoft Security Advisory [973811](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/973811), available in "KB [968389](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/968389/extended-protection-for-authentication) Extended Protection for Authentication", be installed before installing CVE-2017-8563.If you installCVE-2017-8563 without KB [968389](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/968389/extended-protection-for-authentication) on a Domain controller or AD LDS instance, all LDAPS connections will fail with LDAP error 81 - LDAP_SERVER_DOWN. In addition,we strongly recommended that you also review and install the fixes documented in the Known Issues section of KB [968389](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/968389/extended-protection-for-authentication).

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when a man-in-the-middle attacker is able to successfully forward an authentication request to a Windows LDAP server, such as a system running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which has been configured to require signing or sealing on incoming connections.

The update addresses this vulnerability by incorporating support for Extended Protection for Authentication security feature, which allows the LDAP server to detect and block such forwarded authentication requests once enabled.
