## Prerequisites

Most operations in this section require:

- Domain Administrator or equivalent privileges
- Understanding of Active Directory concepts and architecture
- Access to domain controllers and administrative tools
- Proper change management and approval processes

## Best Practices

### Before Performing Operations

1. **Always test in a non-production environment first**
2. **Create system state backups of domain controllers**
3. **Document the current configuration before changes**
4. **Follow proper change management procedures**
5. **Have a rollback plan ready**

### During Operations

1. **Monitor domain controller health and replication**
2. **Verify changes are replicating correctly across sites**
3. **Check event logs for errors or warnings**
4. **Test functionality after making changes**

### After Operations

1. **Verify the change accomplished the intended goal**
2. **Document what was changed and when**
3. **Monitor for any unexpected side effects**
4. **Update documentation and procedures as needed**

## Emergency Procedures

For critical issues, refer to:

- [Active Directory Forest Recovery](active-directory-forest-recovery.md) for disaster recovery
- [Isolate Domain Controller](isolate-domain-controller.md) for security incidents
- [Reset Secure Channel](reset-secure-channel.md) for authentication failures
