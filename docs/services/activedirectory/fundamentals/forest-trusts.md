## Overview

Active Directory forest trusts enable secure authentication and resource access between separate Active Directory forests. They create trusted relationships that allow users in one forest to access resources in another forest while maintaining appropriate security boundaries and administrative control.

Forest trusts are essential for organizations requiring cross-forest collaboration, resource sharing, migrations, or complex enterprise architectures spanning multiple administrative domains.

## Trust Fundamentals

### Trust Relationship Definitions

**Trusted Domain/Forest**
A domain or forest from which users can authenticate to resources in the trusting domain/forest. Users and their accounts exist in the trusted side of the relationship.

**Trusting Domain/Forest**
A domain or forest that contains resources accessible by users from the trusted domain/forest. Resources and services exist in the trusting side of the relationship.

**Trust Path**
An authentication path between domains or forests. When users attempt to access resources outside their home domain/forest, the security subsystem determines the trust path and routes authentication requests accordingly.

### Active Directory Trust Authentication Process

Trust relationships make it possible for users to gain access to resources in domains outside their own. The authentication process follows these steps:

1. **Local Domain Controller Check** - The local domain controller verifies if the requested resource is in the local domain
2. **Trust Path Resolution** - If external, the domain controller determines the trust path to the target domain/forest
3. **Referral Process** - Authentication referrals are provided to appropriate domain controllers
4. **Credential Validation** - User credentials are validated through the trust path
5. **Resource Access** - Upon successful authentication, resource access is granted based on permissions

## Trust Classifications

### Trust Direction

Trust direction determines the flow of authentication requests between forests/domains:

#### One-Way Incoming Trusts

- The local forest is trusted by the specified forest
- Users from the local forest can authenticate in the specified forest
- More restrictive security model

#### One-Way Outgoing Trusts

- The local forest trusts the specified forest
- Users from the specified forest can authenticate in the local forest
- Allows external users access to local resources

#### Two-Way Trusts

- Bidirectional authentication flow
- Each forest is both trusted and trusting
- Authentication referrals work in both directions
- Effectively two one-way trusts in opposite directions

### Trust Types and Characteristics

#### Default Trusts (Automatic)

These trusts are created automatically within forests and are included for completeness:

##### Parent and Child Trusts

- Automatically created when adding child domains to domain trees
- Two-way transitive trusts between parent and child domains
- Authentication requests flow upward through parent domains

##### Tree-Root Trusts

- Automatically created when adding new domain trees to existing forests
- Two-way transitive trusts between forest root and tree root domains

#### Manual Trusts (Configured)

##### External Trusts

- Created between domains in different forests
- Can connect to Windows NT domains or Active Directory domains
- Non-transitive by default (limited to specific domain pairs)
- Can be one-way or two-way
- Suitable for small-scale cross-forest access scenarios

##### Forest Trusts

- Created between forest root domains of different forests
- Enable authentication between all domains in both forests
- Transitive within each forest but non-transitive between forests
- Can be one-way or two-way
- Support Global Catalog queries across forests
- Provide comprehensive cross-forest functionality

##### Shortcut Trusts

- Created between domains within the same forest
- Used to optimize authentication performance
- Reduce authentication path length in complex forest structures
- Can be one-way or two-way, transitive or non-transitive

##### Realm Trusts

- Created between Windows domains and non-Windows Kerberos realms
- Support authentication with UNIX/Linux Kerberos environments
- Can be transitive or non-transitive
- Can be one-way or two-way

### Trust Transitivity

Transitivity determines whether trust relationships extend beyond directly connected domains/forests:

#### Transitive Trusts

- Trust relationships can be extended through intermediate domains/forests
- If Forest A trusts Forest B, and Forest B trusts Forest C, then Forest A may trust Forest C
- Default for forest trusts within forest boundaries
- Provides authentication paths through multiple trust relationships

#### Non-Transitive Trusts

- Trust relationships are limited to directly connected domains/forests
- No authentication path extension through intermediate trusts
- More secure but less flexible
- Default for external trusts and cross-forest boundaries

## Business Use Cases for Trust Relationships

### Migration Scenarios

#### Temporary Migration Trusts

- Enable user access during Active Directory migrations
- Allow gradual resource migration between forests
- Support legacy system access during transition periods
- Facilitate testing and validation of migration processes

### Organizational Collaboration

#### Inter-Organizational Access

- Enable resource sharing between separate organizations
- Support partnership and collaboration requirements
- Provide access to shared services and applications
- Maintain organizational boundaries while enabling cooperation

### Technical Requirements

#### Schema Conflict Avoidance

- Allow organizations to run applications requiring conflicting schema extensions
- Enable custom Active Directory modifications without central approval
- Support specialized applications with unique directory requirements
- Maintain application isolation while sharing core services

### Enterprise Architecture

#### Multi-Forest Environments

- Support complex enterprise architectures
- Enable departmental or regional forest autonomy
- Provide centralized services to distributed forests
- Support mergers, acquisitions, and organizational restructuring

## Trust Implementation Types

### Temporary Trusts

Temporary trusts are established for specific time-limited purposes:

#### Short-Term Trusts (180 days)

- Designed for active migration projects
- Eligible for one-time 180-day extension
- Can be one-way or two-way non-transitive
- Require active migration activities during trust lifetime

#### Long-Term Trusts (365 days)

- For organizations planning near-term migration but unable to move immediately
- Eligible for one-time 180-day extension
- Typically one-way non-transitive only
- Support transition planning and preparation activities

### Persistent Trusts

Persistent trusts are established for ongoing requirements:

#### Operational Trusts

- Long-term collaboration between organizations
- Ongoing resource sharing requirements
- Support for distributed enterprise architectures
- Require governance approval and periodic auditing

#### Technical Trusts

- Organizations unable to consolidate for technical reasons
- Support specialized applications and services
- Enable unique schema or configuration requirements
- Maintain separation while enabling integration

## Security Features and Controls

### Selective Authentication

Selective authentication provides granular access control for trust relationships:

#### Domain-wide Authentication (Default)

- Users from trusted forests can authenticate to all computers
- Simplifies administration but provides broader access
- Appropriate for highly trusted relationships

#### Selective Authentication (Enhanced Security)

- Requires explicit "Allowed to Authenticate" permissions
- Users can only access specifically authorized computers
- Provides additional security layer for sensitive environments
- Recommended for external organization trusts

#### Implementation Requirements

- Set selective authentication property on trust relationship
- Grant "Allowed to Authenticate" permission on target computer objects
- Manage permissions through security groups for scalability
- Implement auditing for authentication permission changes

### SID Filtering

Security Identifier (SID) filtering prevents privilege escalation attacks:

#### SID Filtering Enabled (Default - Recommended)

- Removes SIDs from external domains in authentication tokens
- Prevents administrators from using SID History for privilege escalation
- Provides protection against malicious SID injection
- Required for security compliance in most environments

#### SID Filtering Disabled (Migration Scenarios Only)

- Preserves SID History information in authentication tokens
- Required for migration tools that depend on SID History
- Reduces security but enables migration functionality
- Should be temporary and closely monitored

#### Security Implications

- Enabling SID filtering prevents certain migration tools from working
- Disabling SID filtering creates potential security vulnerabilities
- Migration trusts may require SID filtering exceptions
- Additional security controls needed when SID filtering is disabled

## Kerberos Authentication in Trust Relationships

### Authentication Protocols

#### Kerberos Version 5

- Primary authentication protocol for trust relationships
- Supports cross-realm authentication between forests
- Uses inter-realm keys for secure communication
- Provides mutual authentication between clients and services

#### NTLM Authentication

- Fallback protocol when Kerberos is unavailable
- Less secure than Kerberos authentication
- May be required for legacy applications
- Should be minimized in secure environments

### Kerberos Trust Components

#### Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGT)

- Users obtain TGTs from their home domain Key Distribution Center (KDC)
- TGTs are used to request service tickets across trust boundaries
- Cross-realm TGTs enable authentication in trusted forests

#### Service Tickets

- Cross-domain service tickets provide access to resources
- Obtained through referral process across trust path
- Contain user authentication information and authorization data

#### Inter-realm Keys

- Shared secrets established between trusted domains/forests
- Used to encrypt and validate cross-realm authentication
- Automatically rotated by domain controllers for security

### Authentication Flow Process

1. **Initial Authentication** - User authenticates to home domain KDC
2. **Cross-Realm Request** - User requests access to external forest resource
3. **Referral Chain** - KDCs provide referrals along trust path
4. **Ticket Validation** - Target forest validates authentication tickets
5. **Resource Access** - User gains access based on permissions and group memberships
