## Overview

This section covers the fundamental concepts and architecture of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). Understanding these core concepts is essential for effective Active Directory administration, planning, and troubleshooting.

## What You'll Learn

- **Forest and Domain Architecture**: Understand the hierarchical structure of AD DS
- **Domain Controllers**: Learn about DC roles, placement, and management
- **FSMO Roles**: Master the five Flexible Single Master Operation roles
- **Sites and Subnets**: Configure network topology for optimal replication
- **Global Catalogs**: Understand the role of GC servers in multi-domain environments

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Windows networking concepts
- Familiarity with DNS concepts and configuration
- General knowledge of Windows Server administration

## Learning Path

### 1. Start Here: Forest and Domain Concepts

Begin with understanding the logical structure of Active Directory.

**üìñ [Forests and Domains](forests-and-domains.md)**

- Forest structure and boundaries
- Domain hierarchy and trust relationships
- Namespace planning and design

### 2. Domain Controller Fundamentals

Learn about the servers that host Active Directory services.

**üñ•Ô∏è [Domain Controllers](domain-controllers.md)**

- Domain controller roles and responsibilities  
- Installation and configuration
- Health monitoring and maintenance

### 3. FSMO Role Management

Master the single-master operations that ensure consistency.

**‚öôÔ∏è [FSMO Roles](fsmo-roles.md)**

- Schema Master and Domain Naming Master
- PDC Emulator, RID Master, and Infrastructure Master
- Role placement and transfer procedures

### 4. Network Topology Design

Configure sites and subnets for optimal performance.

**üåê [Sites and Subnets](sites-and-subnets.md)**

- Site topology design principles
- Subnet configuration and management
- Replication scheduling and optimization

### 5. Global Catalog Services

Understand multi-domain search and authentication.

**üîç [Global Catalogs](global-catalogs.md)**

- Global catalog server placement
- Partial attribute set configuration
- Universal group membership caching

## Quick Reference

### Common Administrative Tasks

| Task | Primary Tool | Documentation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| View forest/domain info | `Get-ADForest`, `Get-ADDomain` | [Forests and Domains](forests-and-domains.md) |
| Check DC health | `dcdiag`, `repadmin` | [Domain Controllers](domain-controllers.md) |
| Manage FSMO roles | `netdom query fsmo` | [FSMO Roles](fsmo-roles.md) |
| Configure sites | Active Directory Sites and Services | [Sites and Subnets](sites-and-subnets.md) |
| Global catalog status | `dsquery server -isgc` | [Global Catalogs](global-catalogs.md) |

### Architecture Quick Facts

- **Maximum Forest Functional Level**: Windows Server 2019
- **Maximum Domain Functional Level**: Windows Server 2019
- **Recommended DCs per Site**: Minimum 2 for redundancy
- **Global Catalog Recommendations**: At least one per site
- **FSMO Role Distribution**: Separate infrastructure-critical roles across DCs
