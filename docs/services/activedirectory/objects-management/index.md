## Overview

This section provides comprehensive guidance for managing Active Directory objects, including users, groups, organizational units (OUs), and privileged accounts. Effective object management is crucial for maintaining security, organization, and efficient administration of your Active Directory environment.

## What You'll Learn

- **User Object Management**: Create, modify, and maintain user accounts
- **Group Management**: Understand group types, nesting, and best practices
- **Organizational Units**: Design and implement effective OU structures
- **Privileged Account Management**: Secure and manage high-privilege accounts
- **Delegation and Permissions**: Control who can manage what objects

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Active Directory fundamentals
- Basic knowledge of Windows security principals
- Familiarity with PowerShell for automation tasks

## Core Object Types

### User Objects

Central identity objects representing people, services, or applications.

**üìñ [User Objects](user-objects.md)**

- Account creation and configuration
- Profile and home directory management
- Account lifecycle management
- Bulk user operations with PowerShell

### Group Objects

Security and distribution groups for organizing users and permissions.

**üë• [Group Objects](group-objects.md)**

- Security vs. distribution groups
- Global, domain local, and universal groups
- Group nesting strategies and best practices
- Automated group management

### Organizational Units

Containers for organizing objects and applying policies.

**üè¢ [Organizational Units](organizational-units.md)**

- OU design principles and hierarchy planning
- Delegation of administrative permissions
- Group Policy application and inheritance
- OU management automation

### Privileged Accounts

Special handling for accounts with elevated permissions.

**üîí [Privileged Account Management](privileged-accounts.md)**

- Administrative account separation
- Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)
- Just-in-time access controls
- Monitoring and auditing privileged activities

## Management Workflows

### Daily Operations

| Task | Tool/Method | Documentation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Create user accounts | PowerShell, ADUC | [User Objects](user-objects.md) |
| Modify group membership | `Add-ADGroupMember` | [Group Objects](group-objects.md) |
| Delegate OU permissions | Delegation of Control Wizard | [Organizational Units](organizational-units.md) |
| Review privileged access | PowerShell auditing scripts | [Privileged Accounts](privileged-accounts.md) |

### Automation Scripts

Common PowerShell cmdlets for object management:

```powershell
# User management
New-ADUser -Name "John Doe" -SamAccountName "jdoe"
Set-ADUser -Identity "jdoe" -Department "IT"
Get-ADUser -Filter "Enabled -eq $false"

# Group management  
New-ADGroup -Name "IT-Support" -GroupScope Global
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "IT-Support" -Members "jdoe"
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins"

# OU management
New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "Departments" -Path "DC=contoso,DC=com"
Move-ADObject -Identity "CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=com" -TargetPath "OU=IT,OU=Departments,DC=contoso,DC=com"
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- **User accounts**: First initial + last name (jdoe)
- **Groups**: Purpose-Department-Type (IT-Support-Security)
- **Service accounts**: svc-ServiceName (svc-SQLServer)
- **OUs**: Descriptive and hierarchical (Departments\IT\Servers)

### Security Guidelines

- Implement least privilege principles
- Regular access reviews and cleanup
- Separate administrative accounts from daily-use accounts
- Enable account auditing and monitoring

### Organizational Structure

- Design OU structure based on administrative needs, not org chart
- Use security groups for permissions, not direct user assignments
- Implement consistent delegation patterns
- Plan for scalability and future growth

## Quick Reference Cards

### PowerShell Cmdlets

- `Get-ADUser`, `New-ADUser`, `Set-ADUser`, `Remove-ADUser`
- `Get-ADGroup`, `New-ADGroup`, `Add-ADGroupMember`, `Remove-ADGroupMember`
- `Get-ADOrganizationalUnit`, `New-ADOrganizationalUnit`, `Move-ADObject`
- `Get-ADDomainController`, `Get-ADForest`, `Get-ADDomain`

### Common Filters

- Active users: `Get-ADUser -Filter "Enabled -eq $true"`
- Disabled accounts: `Get-ADUser -Filter "Enabled -eq $false"`
- Recent logins: `Get-ADUser -Filter "LastLogonDate -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30)"`
- Empty groups: `Get-ADGroup -Filter * | Where-Object {!(Get-ADGroupMember $_)}`
