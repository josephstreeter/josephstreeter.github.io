### Threat Hunting

All Sign-ins from IPs used by known bad actors

```kql
let IPAddresses = SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where UserPrincipalName in ("user1@domain.com",
"user2@domain.com",
"user3@domain.com",
"user4@domain.com")
| distinct IPAddress;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where IPAddress in (IPAddresses)
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, AppDisplayName, LocationDetails, ResultDescription
| order by UserPrincipalName
| distinct UserPrincipalName
```

| project Timestamp, SenderFromAddress, SenderMailFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject
| summarize count_ = count() by bin(Timestamp, 1d), SenderFromAddress
| where count_ >= 700
```

Number of messages sent by a user

```kql
EmailEvents
| where RecipientEmailAddress == "salewis1@madisoncollege.edu"
| summarize count_ = count() by SenderMailFromAddress
| order by count_
```
