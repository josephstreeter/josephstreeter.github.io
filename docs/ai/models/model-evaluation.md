## Importance of Evaluation

Why evaluation matters for AI models.

## Evaluation Dimensions

### Accuracy

Correctness of outputs.

### Reliability

Consistency and dependability.

### Robustness

Performance under varied conditions.

### Efficiency

Speed and resource usage.

### Safety

Security and safety considerations.

## Evaluation Metrics

### Language Models

Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, accuracy.

### Classification Models

Precision, recall, F1 score.

### Generation Models

Quality, coherence, relevance.

## Evaluation Methods

### Automated Evaluation

Programmatic testing and metrics.

### Human Evaluation

Manual review and scoring.

### Hybrid Approaches

Combining automated and human evaluation.

## Benchmarks

### Standard Benchmarks

Industry-standard evaluation sets.

### Custom Benchmarks

Creating domain-specific tests.

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

Testing specific capabilities.

### Integration Testing

End-to-end testing.

### Adversarial Testing

Stress testing with edge cases.

### A/B Testing

Comparing model versions.

## Bias and Fairness Evaluation

### Detecting Bias

Identifying biases in outputs.

### Fairness Metrics

Measuring fairness across groups.

## Continuous Evaluation

### Monitoring

Ongoing performance tracking.

### Regression Testing

Ensuring updates don't break functionality.

## Reporting

Documenting evaluation results.

## Improvement Cycles

Using evaluation to drive improvements.
