## What is Fine-tuning?

Definition and purpose of fine-tuning.

## When to Fine-tune

### Use Cases

Scenarios where fine-tuning makes sense.

### Alternatives

When to use prompt engineering instead.

## Prerequisites

### Data Requirements

Quality and quantity of training data.

### Infrastructure

Computational resources needed.
