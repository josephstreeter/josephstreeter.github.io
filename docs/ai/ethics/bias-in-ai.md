## Overview

Introduction to bias in AI systems.

## Types of Bias

### Data Bias

Biases in training data.

### Selection Bias

Non-representative samples.

### Measurement Bias

Biased data collection methods.

### Algorithmic Bias

Bias in model design.

### Confirmation Bias

Reinforcing existing beliefs.

### Historical Bias

Past inequities in data.

### Representation Bias

Underrepresented groups.

## Sources of Bias

### Training Data

Biased datasets.

### Feature Selection

Choice of input features.

### Model Architecture

Design choices that introduce bias.

### Optimization Objectives

Biased optimization goals.

### Human Decisions

Designer and developer biases.

## Impact of Bias

### Individual Harm

Direct discrimination.

### Group Harm

Systematic disadvantages.

### Social Impact

Broader societal effects.

### Economic Consequences

Financial inequities.

### Trust Erosion

Loss of confidence in AI.

## Detection Methods

### Statistical Analysis

Measuring disparities.

### Fairness Metrics

Quantifying fairness.

### Auditing
