## Overview

Introduction to agent development.

## Design Principles

### Goal Definition

Clearly defining objectives.

### Scope Determination

Setting boundaries.

### Interface Design

User and system interactions.

### Error Handling

Managing failures gracefully.

## Architecture Patterns

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

Interleaving thought and action.

### Chain-of-Thought

Sequential reasoning.

### Tree-of-Thought

Exploring multiple paths.

### Planning and Execution

Separate planning phase.

### Feedback Loops

Incorporating results.

## Core Components

### Language Model Integration

Connecting to LLMs.

### Memory Systems

Short-term and long-term memory.

### Tool Integration

Calling external functions.

### Planning Module

Task decomposition and planning.
