## About Me

### IT professional

---
Over 20 years experience. From desktop management and server administration to network engineering and Directory Services. In recent years I have settled primarily in the area of Identity and Access Management.

In addition to my professional work, I do a lot of tinkering around with different technologies. Home Automation and experimenting in the home lab, I'm always doing something. 

### Photographer

---
I am no longer a working as a photographer. I will occasionally take the cameras out and do some shooting. Once upon a time I used to shoot a lot of sports. During my time in Iraq I worked with two fellow Soldiers to write and publish and photographic history of our unit's time in country.
