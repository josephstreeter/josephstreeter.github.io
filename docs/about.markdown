I am an IT professional with over 20 years experience. From desktop management and server administration to network engineering. In recent years I have settled primarily in the area of Identity and Access Management. 

In addition to my professional work, I do a lot of tinkering around with different technologies. This blog will be a notebook of sorts for home projects and learning efforts.
