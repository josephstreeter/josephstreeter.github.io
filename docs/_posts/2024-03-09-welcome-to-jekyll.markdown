Welcome (back?) to this blog. There isn't much to look at from this point back. I used to put stuff out here as a kind of online notebook. It started out as a Drupal site, it was migrated to Wordpress, and now it's sitting on GitHub Pages as a Jekyll site. 

At some point in the migrations all the dates were lost. That's why all the posts seem to happen on two days a lot of years ago. Most of it is old garbage for stuff that doesn't exist anymore. Why is it here? Because I started over with this site and thought it should have some content so that it wasn't empty. Hopefully I will get to posting new things and no one will notice this old garbage I posted a decade ago. It is something of a "way back machine" for me though. Please don't judge current me based on old me.
