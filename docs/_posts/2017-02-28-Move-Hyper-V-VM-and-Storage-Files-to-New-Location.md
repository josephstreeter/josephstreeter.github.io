The following script will move all of the VMs on a Hyper-V host to a new storage location. In this case we are moving the VMs from "C:\VM\VirtualMachines\" to "D:\VM\VirtualMachines\." This script assumes that the VM disks are kept in the VM folder and not in a separate location.

{% highlight powershell %}
$VMs=Get-VM
$Path="D:\VM\VirtualMachines\$($VM.Name)"

foreach ($VM in $VMs)
{
Move-VMStorage -VM $(Get-VM $VM.Name) -DestinationStoragePath $Path
}
{% endhighlight %}
