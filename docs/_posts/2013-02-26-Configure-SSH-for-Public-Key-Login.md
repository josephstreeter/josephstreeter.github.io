Some quick notes on creating and using a key pair for SSH logon.

1. Generate key pair on the client.

```console
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```

2. Enter a passphrase when prompted. If you do not want a password so that you can use this key pair for automating logons just press Enter twice.
3. Copy the public key from the client to the server

```console
scp ./ssh/id_rsa.pub username@server:.ssh/authorized_keys
```

The ssh-copy-id command, if it is available, can be used to copy the public key to the server as well.

```console
ssh-copy-id username@server
```

4. Secure the .ssh folder on the server

```console
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
