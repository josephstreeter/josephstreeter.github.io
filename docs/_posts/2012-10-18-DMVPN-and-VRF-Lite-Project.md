We're working on a project to expand the single cloud - single hub DMVPN to a dual hub - dual cloud DMVPN. This will provide us with some fault tolerance in the event of a hub failure.

We are also planning the use of VRF-Lite in order to carry some other networks, including commercial Internet, to our remote sites. With a little luck (and some documentation) this should keep the security Nazis happy.
