A Wired magazine article about Amateur radio.

"Somehow it makes little sense that amateur â€œham radio continues to thrive in the age of Twitter, Facebook and iPhones. Yet the century-old communications technology â€” which demands such commitment that you must generally pass an exam to receive a license â€” currently attracts around 350,000 practitioners in Europe, and a further 700,000 in the United States, some 60 per cent more than 30 years ago."
