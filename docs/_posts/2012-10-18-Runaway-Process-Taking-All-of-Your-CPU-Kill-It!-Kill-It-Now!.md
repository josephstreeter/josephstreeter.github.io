Here is a PowerShell script that will find the process using the most CPU and then kills that process.

{% highlight powershell %}
$strProc = gps | sort cpu -desc | select -first 1
$strProc.kill()
{% endhighlight %}

Schedule it to run every once in a while and let it go. I think I would like to narrow the list if processes that it could shut off though.
