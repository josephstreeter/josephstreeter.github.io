Just a couple links for some documents involving an Active Directory environment that lives in the magical world of VMWare:


- <a href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/Virtualizing_Windows_Active_Directory.pdf">VMWare: Virtualizing Windows Active Directory (White Paper)</a>
- <a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/courseware/79218/EA6705_Formatted_v2.pdf">VMWare: Best Practices for Virtualizing Active Directory (VMWorld 2010 </a>

- Optimizing network performance
- DNS modifications
- Replication information
