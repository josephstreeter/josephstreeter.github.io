I get a lot of questions from recuiters and employers about my knowledege of SCCM and SCOM. Since I have not really played with SCCM since we moved from SMS 2003 and I was never given the money to buy MOM/SCOM I decided it's time to make myself a lab.
I've found some articles dealing with the setup and configuration of SCCM and SCOM. It is really nice to be able to download and try out some of the technology that Microsoft has.
