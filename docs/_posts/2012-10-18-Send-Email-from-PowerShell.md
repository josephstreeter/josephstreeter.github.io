Sometimes, even though you feel as though you have too much email, you want one of your machines to send you even more. It's pretty simple to use PowerShell as long as you have a host to relay SMTP for you.
{% highlight powershell %}
Send-MailMessage [-To] <string[]> [-Subject] <string> -From <string> [[-Body] <string>] [[-SmtpServer] <string>] [-Attachments <string[]>] [-Bcc <string[]
>] [-BodyAsHtml] [-Cc <string[]>] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-DeliveryNotificationOption {None | OnSuccess | OnFailure | Delay | Never}] [-Encoding <En
coding>] [-Priority {Normal | Low | High}] [-UseSsl] [CommonParameters]
{% endhighlight %}
<b>Example</b>
{% highlight powershell %}
Send-MailMessage -to *alias@domain* -subject test -from *alias@domain* -body test -smtpserver *ip-address*
{% endhighlight %}
