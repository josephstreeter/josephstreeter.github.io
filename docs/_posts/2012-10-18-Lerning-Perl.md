I've been working in Perl for about a year now. I started using it as a way to manage Cisco equipment and Linux servers. While I'm getting better at it I'm not what I would consider a wizard at it yet.

This is a PDF reference that i've stumbled across:
<a href="http://www.ebb.org/PickingUpPerl/">Picking up Perl</a>

Some books by O'Reilly:
<a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl4/index.htm">Perl CD Bookshelf</a>
