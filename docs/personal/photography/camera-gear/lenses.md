# Lenses

Master the art of lens selection and understand how different focal lengths, apertures, and optical designs affect your photography. This comprehensive guide covers everything from kit lenses to professional glass.

## Overview

Lenses are arguably more important than camera bodies for image quality and creative expression. Unlike camera bodies that you might replace every few years, quality lenses can last decades and retain their value.

## Lens Fundamentals

### Focal Length

**Focal length** determines the angle of view and magnification of your lens.

#### Wide-Angle Lenses (10-35mm)

- **Ultra-Wide (10-24mm)**: Dramatic perspective, architecture, landscapes
- **Wide (24-35mm)**: Environmental portraits, group shots, real estate

#### Standard Lenses (35-85mm)

- **Normal (35-50mm)**: Natural perspective similar to human vision
- **Short Telephoto (50-85mm)**: Portraits, street photography

#### Telephoto Lenses (85mm+)

- **Medium Telephoto (85-135mm)**: Portrait photography, subject isolation
- **Long Telephoto (200mm+)**: Wildlife, sports, distant subjects

#### Specialty Lenses

- **Macro**: Close-up photography (1:1 magnification or greater)
- **Fish-eye**: Extreme wide-angle with distinctive distortion
- **Tilt-Shift**: Perspective control and creative focus effects

### Aperture

**Maximum aperture** affects depth of field, low-light performance, and lens size.

#### Fast Lenses (f/1.4-f/2.8)

- **Advantages**: Shallow depth of field, excellent low-light performance
- **Disadvantages**: Larger, heavier, more expensive
- **Best For**: Portraits, low-light photography, professional work

#### Standard Lenses (f/3.5-f/5.6)

- **Advantages**: Smaller, lighter, more affordable
- **Disadvantages**: Limited low-light capability, less background blur
- **Best For**: General photography, beginners, travel

### Lens Construction

#### Prime vs Zoom Lenses

**Prime Lenses (Fixed Focal Length):**

- **Advantages**: Sharper optics, wider maximum apertures, smaller size
- **Disadvantages**: Less versatile, need multiple lenses
- **Best For**: Portraits, low-light, artistic photography

**Zoom Lenses (Variable Focal Length):**

- **Advantages**: Versatile, convenient, fewer lens changes
- **Disadvantages**: More complex optics, variable aperture
- **Best For**: Travel, event photography, general use

## Essential Lens Types

### Kit Lenses (18-55mm, 24-70mm)

**Most cameras come with a kit lens** - typically an 18-55mm or 24-70mm zoom.

#### Advantages

- **Versatile focal range**: Covers wide to short telephoto
- **Affordable**: Often bundled with camera body
- **Lightweight**: Good for travel and everyday use
- **Image Stabilization**: Many include optical stabilization

#### Limitations

- **Variable aperture**: Usually f/3.5-5.6, limiting low-light use
- **Build quality**: Plastic construction, less durable
- **Optical quality**: Good but not exceptional sharpness

#### Making the Most of Kit Lenses

- **Use optimal apertures**: Usually f/8-f/11 for sharpest results
- **Avoid extremes**: Best performance in middle of zoom range
- **Consider upgrading**: To constant aperture zoom or prime lenses

### 50mm Prime Lenses

**The "nifty fifty"** is often recommended as the first prime lens purchase.

#### Why 50mm?

- **Natural perspective**: Similar to human vision
