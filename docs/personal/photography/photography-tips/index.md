## Quick Reference Guides

### Essential Camera Settings by Genre

#### Portrait Photography

- **Aperture**: f/1.4 - f/5.6 (shallow depth of field)
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/focal length minimum
- **ISO**: 100-800 (keep noise low)
- **Focus**: Single-point AF on eyes

#### Landscape Photography

- **Aperture**: f/8 - f/11 (maximum sharpness)
- **Shutter Speed**: Varies by effect desired
- **ISO**: 100-200 (base ISO when possible)
- **Focus**: Hyperfocal distance or focus stacking

#### Street Photography

- **Aperture**: f/5.6 - f/8 (good depth of field)
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/125s minimum for sharp subjects
- **ISO**: Auto or up to 1600
- **Focus**: Zone focusing or continuous AF

#### Action Photography

- **Aperture**: f/2.8 - f/5.6 (fast enough shutter)
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/500s+ to freeze motion
- **ISO**: Adjust for proper exposure
- **Focus**: Continuous AF with tracking

### Composition Quick Tips

#### Rule of Thirds

- Place subjects on intersection points
- Align horizons with grid lines
- Create more dynamic compositions

#### Leading Lines

- Use roads, rivers, or architectural elements
- Guide viewer's eye to main subject
- Create depth and movement in images

#### Framing

- Use natural elements as frames
- Draw attention to main subject
- Add context and depth

#### Symmetry and Patterns

- Look for repeating elements
- Break patterns for visual interest
- Use reflections effectively

### Lighting Guidelines

#### Golden Hour (Sunrise/Sunset)

- Warm, soft light
- Long shadows for depth

- Plan timing with sun calculator apps

#### Blue Hour (Twilight)

- Even, diffused light
- Balanced exposure between sky and ground
- Great for cityscapes and landscapes
- Use tripod for longer exposures

#### Overcast Days

- Soft, even lighting
- Perfect for portraits
- Saturated colors
- No harsh shadows

#### Harsh Midday Sun

- Use shadows creatively
- Look for reflected light
- Consider black and white
- Use fill flash for portraits

## Creative Techniques
