- **Shutter Speed**: Controls motion blur and light duration
- **ISO**: Controls sensor sensitivity to light

#### Composition Fundamentals

- **Rule of Thirds**: Divide frame into thirds for balanced composition
- **Leading Lines**: Use lines to guide viewer's eye through the image
- **Framing**: Use natural elements to frame your subject
- **Symmetry and Patterns**: Create visual interest through repetition
- **Depth**: Use foreground, middle ground, and background elements

### Equipment Recommendations for Beginners
