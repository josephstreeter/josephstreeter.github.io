## VS Code Snippets for PowerShell

Snippets are reusable code templates that accelerate development by providing instant access to commonly used code patterns. This guide covers creating, configuring, and using snippets effectively in VS Code for PowerShell development.

---

## Understanding Snippets

Snippets provide instant access to code templates through trigger words. They support:

- **Tab stops** (`$1`, `$2`) for cursor positioning
- **Placeholders** (`${1:defaultText}`) with default values
- **Variables** for dynamic content insertion
- **Multi-cursor editing** for linked placeholders

### Accessing Snippets

**Methods to insert snippets:**

1. **IntelliSense**: Type the prefix and select from suggestions
2. **Quick Actions**: Press `Ctrl+.` and select from snippet menu
3. **Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Insert Snippet"

---

## Configuring Custom Snippets

### Access Snippet Configuration

1. **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. **Type**: "Configure User Snippets"
3. **Select**: Language (e.g., "powershell.json") or "New Global Snippets file"
4. **Edit**: Add custom snippets to the JSON file

### Snippet File Structure

### JSON Format and Structure

Snippets are defined in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
    "Snippet Name": {
        "prefix": "trigger-word",
        "body": [
            "Line 1 of code",
            "Line 2 with ${1:placeholder}",
            "Line 3 with $2"
        ],
        "description": "Description shown in IntelliSense"
    }
}
```

**Key Elements:**

- **prefix**: Trigger word(s) that activate the snippet
- **body**: Array of strings representing code lines
- **description**: Optional description for IntelliSense
- **scope**: Optional language restriction

---

## PowerShell Administrative Snippets

The following snippets provide common administrative functions for PowerShell development:

## Best Practices for Snippet Creation

### Naming Conventions

- **Use descriptive names**: Make snippet names clear and self-explanatory
- **Consistent prefixes**: Use consistent prefixes for related snippets (e.g., `connect-`, `new-`, `get-`)
- **Avoid conflicts**: Check for existing snippet prefixes to avoid conflicts

### Content Guidelines

- **Include error handling**: Always add try-catch blocks for robust code
- **Use proper formatting**: Follow PowerShell style guidelines
- **Add parameter validation**: Include proper parameter attributes
- **Document functionality**: Provide clear descriptions for each snippet

### Tab Stops and Placeholders

- **Logical order**: Number tab stops in the order users will fill them
- **Meaningful defaults**: Provide sensible default values in placeholders
- **Connected placeholders**: Use same numbers for related values

## Advanced Snippet Features

### Variables

VS Code supports several built-in variables in snippets:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT` | Currently selected text |
| `$TM_CURRENT_LINE` | Current line content |
| `$TM_CURRENT_WORD` | Current word under cursor |
| `$TM_LINE_INDEX` | Zero-based line number |
| `$TM_LINE_NUMBER` | One-based line number |
| `$TM_FILENAME` | Current filename |
| `$TM_FILENAME_BASE` | Filename without extension |
| `$TM_DIRECTORY` | Directory of current file |
| `$TM_FILEPATH` | Full file path |
| `$WORKSPACE_NAME` | Workspace name |
| `$WORKSPACE_FOLDER` | Workspace folder path |

### Date and Time Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `$CURRENT_YEAR` | Current year | 2024 |
| `$CURRENT_MONTH` | Current month | 07 |
| `$CURRENT_DATE` | Current date | 15 |
| `$CURRENT_HOUR` | Current hour | 14 |
