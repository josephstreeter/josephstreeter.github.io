## Glossary

### A

**API Documentation**
: Automated documentation generated from source code comments and specifications that describes application programming interfaces, including endpoints, parameters, and responses.

**Azure App Service**
: Microsoft's platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends in the cloud.

**Azure DevOps**
: Microsoft's suite of development tools including version control, project management, CI/CD pipelines, and collaboration features.

**Azure Pipelines**
: Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) service that automatically builds, tests, and deploys code to any platform and cloud.

### B

**Branch Protection**
: Git repository settings that enforce rules for code changes, requiring pull requests, reviews, and status checks before merging to protected branches.

**Build Artifacts**
: Files and folders generated during the documentation build process, including compiled HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.

**Build Pipeline**
: Automated process that compiles source documentation into a publishable format, including validation, testing, and artifact generation.

### C

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**
: Development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production environments.

**Cross-Reference**
: Links between documentation pages and sections that help readers navigate related content and maintain content relationships.

**Custom Domain**
: Personalized web address (e.g., docs.company.com) that points to your documentation site instead of using default hosting URLs.

### D

**DaC (Documentation as Code)**
: Methodology that applies software development principles and practices to documentation creation, management, and deployment.

**DocFX**
: Microsoft's static site generator designed for building documentation websites from Markdown files and source code comments.

**Deployment Slot**
: Azure App Service feature that allows you to deploy different versions of your application to separate environments for testing before production.

### F

**Frontmatter**
: Metadata block at the beginning of Markdown files that contains information like title, description, tags, and configuration settings.

### G

**Git**
: Distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code and documentation files during software development.

**GitHub Actions**
: CI/CD platform that allows you to automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository.

### H

**HTML Rendering**
: Process of converting Markdown and other source formats into HTML for web browser display.

### I

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
: Practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes.

### M

**Markdown**
: Lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed to be converted to HTML and other formats.

**Metadata**
: Data that provides information about other data, such as page titles, descriptions, tags, and creation dates in documentation files.

**Multi-stage Pipeline**
: CI/CD pipeline configuration that separates the build, test, and deployment processes into distinct stages with different environments.

### P

**Pull Request (PR)**
: Method of submitting contributions to a project where proposed changes are reviewed before being merged into the main codebase.

**Pipeline Trigger**
: Conditions that automatically start a CI/CD pipeline, such as code commits, pull requests, or scheduled times.

### Q

**Quality Gate**
: Automated checkpoint in the CI/CD pipeline that enforces quality standards before allowing deployment to proceed.

### R

**Repository**
: Storage location for project files including source code, documentation, and configuration files, typically managed by version control systems.

**Responsive Design**
: Web design approach that ensures documentation displays properly across different devices and screen sizes.

### S

**Semantic Versioning**
: Versioning scheme using three numbers (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to communicate the nature of changes in software releases.

**Static Site Generator**
: Tool that generates a complete static website from source files, templates, and content, producing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

**Service Connection**
: Secure connection between Azure DevOps and external services like Azure subscriptions for automated deployments.

### T

**Table of Contents (TOC)**
: Structured navigation system that organizes documentation content hierarchically for easy discovery and browsing.

**Template**
: Predefined structure or format for creating consistent documentation pages with standardized layouts and content organization.

**Theme**
: Collection of templates, stylesheets, and assets that define the visual appearance and layout of a documentation website.

### V

**Version Control**
: System for tracking and managing changes to files over time, allowing multiple contributors to collaborate and maintain change history.

### W

**Webhook**
: HTTP callback that triggers automated actions when specific events occur in external systems like repositories or deployment platforms.

**Workflow**
: Series of automated steps or manual processes that define how documentation is created, reviewed, tested, and published.

### Y

**YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)**
: Human-readable data serialization standard commonly used for configuration files, including CI/CD pipeline definitions and frontmatter.
