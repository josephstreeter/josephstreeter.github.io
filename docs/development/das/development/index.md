## Development Workflow

Effective development workflows are essential for successful Documentation as Code implementation. This section covers daily development practices, collaboration processes, and quality assurance procedures that ensure high-quality documentation while maintaining team productivity.

## Overview

Documentation as Code development follows software development best practices adapted for content creation. The workflow emphasizes:

- **Version Control**: All changes tracked and reviewable
- **Collaboration**: Multiple contributors working efficiently
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated and manual quality checks
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Iterative Improvement**: Regular feedback and refinement

## Workflow Components

## Daily Development Process

### Morning Routine

**Team Synchronization:**

```bash
# 1. Start development session
cd documentation-repository

# 2. Sync with remote repository
git fetch origin
git status

# 3. Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 4. Check for updates in assigned issues
# Review Azure DevOps work items and pull requests

# 5. Plan daily work
# Review content roadmap and priorities
```

### Content Development Cycle

**Feature Branch Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch for new content
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication-guide

# 2. Set up development environment
npm install
npm run build-serve

# 3. Create content outline
# - Define scope and audience
# - Create table of contents
# - Identify required assets

# 4. Develop content iteratively
# - Write content sections
# - Add code examples and images
# - Test locally after each section

# 5. Validate content quality
npm run validate

# 6. Commit incremental changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add: user authentication overview section"
```
