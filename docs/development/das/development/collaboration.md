## Quality Assurance

### Automated Quality Checks

**Pre-commit Hooks:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .githooks/pre-commit

# Run spell check
echo "Running spell check..."
npx cspell "**/*.md"

# Validate markdown
echo "Validating markdown..."
npx markdownlint "**/*.md"

# Check links
echo "Checking links..."
npx markdown-link-check "**/*.md" --config .mlc-config.json

# Validate frontmatter
echo "Validating frontmatter..."
python scripts/validate-frontmatter.py

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Pre-commit checks failed. Please fix issues before committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "All pre-commit checks passed!"
```

**Pull Request Validation:**

```yaml
# .azure-pipelines/pr-validation.yml
trigger: none
pr:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
    - develop

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '18.x'
