## Security Best Practices for Documentation as Code

This guide outlines security considerations and best practices when implementing a Documentation as Code (DaC) workflow with DocFX and Azure DevOps.

## Access Control and Authentication

### Repository Access Management

- **Fine-grained Permissions**: Configure repository permissions based on roles (contributor, reviewer, maintainer)
- **Branch Protection**: Require pull requests and code reviews for changes to main branches
- **Service Account Management**: Use dedicated service accounts with limited permissions for automated processes

### Authentication Best Practices

- **Use Azure AD Authentication**: Integrate with your organization's Azure Active Directory
- **Enable MFA**: Require multi-factor authentication for all team members
- **Token Management**: Rotate access tokens regularly and use scoped tokens for specific functions

## Content Security

### Sensitive Information Protection

- **Secret Detection**: Implement scanning for accidentally committed secrets
- **PII Management**: Use content scanning to prevent exposure of personally identifiable information
- **Information Classification**: Establish clear guidelines for content classification

### Secure Documentation Pipelines

- **Pipeline Security**: Configure pipeline permissions with least-privilege access
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in documentation dependencies
- **Build Validation**: Validate all documentation PRs with automated security checks

## Infrastructure Security

### Secure Hosting

- **Azure App Service Security**: Configure Web Application Firewall for documentation sites
- **Network Security Groups**: Restrict access to build and deployment resources
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure all documentation is served over HTTPS

### Backup and Recovery

- **Content Backups**: Implement regular backups of documentation repositories
- **Disaster Recovery**: Create a disaster recovery plan for documentation infrastructure
- **Retention Policies**: Define content retention policies that balance compliance and security

## Compliance and Governance

### Regulatory Compliance

- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed logs of documentation changes and access
- **Compliance Requirements**: Document how your DaC implementation meets regulatory requirements
- **Security Reviews**: Schedule regular security reviews of your documentation platform

### Security Governance

- **Security Policies**: Document security policies specific to documentation workflows
- **Training**: Provide security training for documentation contributors
- **Incident Response**: Create an incident response plan for documentation security issues

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Configure Azure AD integration for repository access
- [ ] Implement branch protection rules for documentation repositories
- [ ] Set up automated scanning for secrets and sensitive information
- [ ] Configure secure CI/CD pipelines for documentation
- [ ] Enable HTTPS for all documentation endpoints
- [ ] Document security policies specific to the DaC workflow
- [ ] Establish regular security reviews for documentation infrastructure
