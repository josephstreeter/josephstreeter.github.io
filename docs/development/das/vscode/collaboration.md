## Collaboration Workflows

Effective team collaboration is essential for successful Documentation as Code implementations. This guide covers Git integration, collaborative editing techniques, and team workflow optimization using VS Code.

## Git Integration

### Core Git Features in VS Code

VS Code provides comprehensive Git integration for documentation workflows:

#### Source Control Panel

Access Git features through the integrated Source Control panel:

- **View Changes**: See modified files at a glance
- **Stage Changes**: Select files for commit
- **Commit Messages**: Write descriptive commit messages
- **Branch Management**: Create, switch, and merge branches
- **Diff View**: Compare file versions side by side

#### Command Palette Git Commands

Quick access to Git operations:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `Git: Clone` | Clone repository to local workspace |
| `Git: Commit` | Commit staged changes |
| `Git: Push` | Push commits to remote repository |
| `Git: Pull` | Pull latest changes from remote |
| `Git: Create Branch` | Create new branch |
| `Git: Merge Branch` | Merge branch into current |

### Branch Strategies for Documentation

#### Feature Branch Workflow

Implement systematic branch management for documentation updates:

```bash
# Create feature branch for new content
git checkout -b feature/azure-deployment-guide

# Work on documentation
# Stage and commit changes
git add docs/deployment/azure-app-service.md
git commit -m "Add Azure App Service deployment guide

- Add step-by-step deployment instructions
- Include troubleshooting section
- Add screenshots and examples"

# Push branch and create pull request
git push origin feature/azure-deployment-guide
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions

Establish consistent naming patterns:

```text
feature/topic-name          # New content or major updates
fix/issue-description       # Bug fixes or corrections
update/section-name         # Content updates and improvements
docs/structural-changes     # Documentation structure changes
```

### Commit Message Best Practices

#### Structured Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages for documentation changes:

```text
Add comprehensive Azure deployment guide

- Include prerequisites and setup instructions
- Add step-by-step deployment procedures
- Document common troubleshooting scenarios
- Include screenshots for visual guidance

Resolves: #123
Related: #456
```

#### Commit Message Template

Create a template for consistent messaging:

```text
# .gitmessage template
# <type>: <description>
#
# Body (optional):
# - What changes were made
# - Why the changes were necessary
# - Any breaking changes or migration notes
#
# Footer (optional):
# Closes: #issue
# Related: #issue
```

Configure Git to use the template:

```bash
git config commit.template .gitmessage
```
