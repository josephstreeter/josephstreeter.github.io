## Documentation as Code

Documentation as Code (DaC) is a methodology that treats documentation with the same principles and practices used for software development. By storing documentation alongside code in version control systems, applying automated testing, and using CI/CD pipelines for deployment, organizations can ensure their documentation remains accurate, up-to-date, and synchronized with their software releases.

## Overview

This comprehensive guide covers implementing Documentation as Code using:

- **DocFX** for static site generation
- **Azure DevOps Repositories** for version control and collaboration
- **Azure App Service** for hosting and deployment
- **Azure Pipelines** for continuous integration and deployment

## Why Documentation as Code?

### Traditional Documentation Challenges

Traditional documentation approaches often suffer from:

- **Outdated Information**: Documentation quickly becomes stale without regular updates
- **Version Inconsistencies**: Difficulty maintaining documentation versions aligned with software releases
- **Accessibility Issues**: Documentation stored in proprietary formats or isolated systems
- **Poor Collaboration**: Limited ability for multiple contributors to work efficiently
- **Manual Processes**: Time-consuming manual updates and deployments

### Benefits of Documentation as Code

#### Version Control Integration

- Track all changes with detailed commit history
- Branch and merge documentation changes alongside code
- Rollback to previous versions when needed
- Maintain consistency across environments

#### Automated Workflows

- Continuous integration testing for documentation builds
- Automated deployment to staging and production environments
- Pull request reviews ensure quality and accuracy
- Integration with existing development workflows

#### Enhanced Collaboration

- Multiple contributors can work simultaneously
- Peer review process through pull requests
- Issue tracking and discussion threads
- Integration with development team workflows

#### Quality Assurance

- Automated link checking and validation
- Consistent formatting through templates
- Spell checking and grammar validation
- Visual regression testing for layout changes

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Azure DevOps Repositories** | Source control and collaboration | Git repositories, branch policies, pull requests |
| **DocFX** | Static site generation | Markdown processing, API documentation, themes |
| **Azure Pipelines** | CI/CD automation | Build validation, testing, deployment |
| **Azure App Service** | Web hosting | Scalable hosting, custom domains, SSL certificates |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before implementing Documentation as Code, ensure you have:

- **Azure Subscription** with appropriate permissions
- **Azure DevOps Organization** and project access
- **DocFX** installed locally for development
- **Git** knowledge and tooling
- **Markdown** writing proficiency

### Quick Start Checklist

1. ☐ [Set up Azure DevOps Repository](setup/azure-devops.md)
2. ☐ [Configure DocFX Project](setup/docfx-configuration.md)
3. ☐ [Create Azure App Service](setup/azure-app-service.md)
4. ☐ [Configure CI/CD Pipeline](setup/cicd-pipeline.md)
5. ☐ [Implement Content Strategy](content/content-strategy.md)
6. ☐ [Set up Local Development](development/local-development.md)

## Key Concepts

### Content Structure

Documentation as Code follows a structured approach to content organization:

```text
docs/
├── articles/          # Long-form content
├── api/              # API documentation
├── tutorials/        # Step-by-step guides
├── reference/        # Reference materials
├── images/           # Media assets
├── templates/        # DocFX templates
├── toc.yml          # Table of contents
└── docfx.json       # DocFX configuration
```

### Workflow Integration

The Documentation as Code workflow integrates seamlessly with software development:

1. **Feature Development**: Documentation changes accompany code changes
2. **Pull Request Review**: Both code and documentation are reviewed together
3. **Automated Testing**: Documentation builds and validates automatically
4. **Deployment**: Documentation deploys alongside application releases
5. **Monitoring**: Track documentation health and usage metrics

### Quality Standards

Maintaining high-quality documentation requires:

- **Consistent Style**: Standardized writing style and formatting guidelines
- **Accuracy Validation**: Regular review and update processes
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with web accessibility standards
- **Performance**: Optimized loading times and responsive design
- **SEO Optimization**: Search engine friendly structure and metadata

## Implementation Phases
