## Setup and Configuration

This section provides detailed instructions for setting up the complete Documentation as Code infrastructure using Azure DevOps, DocFX, and Azure App Service.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the setup process, ensure you have:

### Required Access and Permissions

- **Azure Subscription** with Contributor or Owner permissions
- **Azure DevOps Organization** with Project Administrator access
- **Domain Management** access (if using custom domains)
- **Development Environment** with administrative privileges

### Required Software

- **Git** (version 2.20 or later)
- **Node.js** (version 16 or later)
- **DocFX** (latest stable version)
- **Azure CLI** (latest version)
- **PowerShell** (version 7 or later)

### Knowledge Requirements

- Basic understanding of Git workflows
- Familiarity with Azure services
- Markdown writing proficiency
- YAML configuration basics

## Setup Sequence

Follow these steps in order for a successful implementation:

1. **[Azure DevOps Repository Setup](azure-devops.md)** - Configure source control and collaboration
2. **[DocFX Project Configuration](docfx-configuration.md)** - Set up static site generation
3. **[Azure App Service Creation](azure-app-service.md)** - Configure web hosting
4. **[CI/CD Pipeline Setup](cicd-pipeline.md)** - Implement automated deployment

## Environment Planning

### Development Environment

**Local Development Setup:**

- Individual developer workstations
- DocFX installation and configuration
- Git repository cloning
- Local build and preview capabilities

**Collaboration Tools:**

- Visual Studio Code with extensions
- Git GUI tools (optional)
- Markdown editors and preview tools
- Azure DevOps browser access

### Cloud Infrastructure

**Resource Naming Convention:**

```text
{project}-{environment}-{service}-{region}
├── docs-dev-app-eastus          # Development App Service
├── docs-prod-app-eastus         # Production App Service
├── docs-shared-rg-eastus        # Shared Resource Group
└── docs-devops-proj             # Azure DevOps Project
```

**Resource Organization:**

- **Resource Groups**: Separate development and production
- **App Service Plans**: Appropriate sizing for each environment
- **Application Insights**: Monitoring and analytics
- **Key Vault**: Secure configuration storage

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

**Azure DevOps Security:**

- Branch protection policies
- Pull request requirements
- Code review assignments
- Service connection security

**Azure App Service Security:**

- Managed identity configuration
- Network access restrictions
- SSL certificate management
- Security headers configuration

### Secrets Management

**Sensitive Information Handling:**

- Azure Key Vault integration
- Environment variable security
- Connection string protection
- API key management

## Network Configuration

### Domain and DNS

**Custom Domain Setup:**

- Domain registration or delegation
- DNS zone configuration
- SSL certificate acquisition
- CDN integration (optional)

**Network Security:**

- Application Gateway configuration
- Firewall rules
- DDoS protection
- Geographic restrictions

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Application Insights

**Telemetry Configuration:**

- Page view tracking
- User behavior analytics
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting

**Custom Metrics:**

- Documentation usage patterns
- Search query analytics
- Content effectiveness metrics
- User engagement tracking

## Backup and Recovery

### Data Protection

**Repository Backup:**

- Azure DevOps backup policies
- Git repository mirroring
- Content export procedures
- Version history preservation

**Application Recovery:**

- App Service backup configuration
- Database backup (if applicable)
- Configuration backup
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Performance Optimization

### Initial Configuration

**App Service Performance:**

- Appropriate service plan selection
- Auto-scaling configuration
- Application settings optimization
- Connection pooling setup

**Content Delivery:**

- CDN integration planning
- Static asset optimization
- Caching strategy implementation
- Compression configuration

## Validation Checklist

Before proceeding to the next phase, verify:

### Infrastructure Validation

- [ ] Azure DevOps repository created and accessible
- [ ] DocFX project builds successfully locally
- [ ] Azure App Service deploys and serves content
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs without errors
- [ ] Custom domain resolves correctly (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL certificates are valid and configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are functional

### Access Validation

- [ ] Team members can access Azure DevOps
- [ ] Pull request workflows function correctly
- [ ] Deployment permissions are properly configured
- [ ] Service connections are authenticated
- [ ] Key Vault access is working

### Security Validation

- [ ] Branch protection policies are enforced
- [ ] Secrets are stored securely
- [ ] Network access is properly restricted
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] Authentication is working correctly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Setup Problems

**Azure DevOps Issues:**

- Permission denied errors
- Service connection failures
- Repository access problems
- Pipeline execution failures

**DocFX Build Issues:**

- NuGet package restoration failures
- Template compilation errors
- Markdown parsing problems
- Asset reference issues

**Azure App Service Issues:**

- Deployment failures
- Runtime errors
- Configuration problems
- Performance issues

### Resolution Strategies

**Diagnostic Tools:**

- Azure DevOps build logs
- App Service diagnostic tools
- Application Insights telemetry
- Browser developer tools

**Common Solutions:**

- Clear caches and restart services
- Verify configuration settings
- Check permission assignments
- Review log files for errors

## Next Steps

Once setup is complete:

1. **[Content Strategy Planning](../content/index.md)** - Organize your documentation approach
2. **[Development Workflow Setup](../development/index.md)** - Establish daily processes
3. **[Team Training](../advanced/team-training.md)** - Educate team members
4. **[Content Migration](../content/migration.md)** - Move existing documentation
