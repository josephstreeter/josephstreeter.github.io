# Setting Up Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines automates building, testing, and deploying your code. It supports many languages and platforms, including containers and cloud deployments.

## Creating a Pipeline

1. Go to **Pipelines** in your Azure DevOps project.
2. Click **New Pipeline** and follow the wizard to connect your repo.
3. Choose a starter template or define your own YAML pipeline.
4. Save and run the pipeline to see automated builds and tests.

## Key Concepts

- **Build Pipeline:** Compiles and tests your code.
- **Release Pipeline:** Deploys your application to environments.
- **YAML Pipelines:** Define CI/CD as code for versioning and reuse.

## Tips

- Use pipeline variables and secrets for configuration.
- Add build badges to your README for visibility.
