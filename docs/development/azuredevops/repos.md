# Using Azure Repos

Azure Repos provides unlimited, cloud-hosted private Git repositories for your project. It supports collaboration, code reviews, and branch policies to ensure code quality.

## Key Steps

1. **Clone a Repository**
   - Use the provided Git URL to clone your repo: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Commit and Push Changes**
   - Make changes locally, then use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to update the remote repo.
3. **Branching and Pull Requests**
   - Create branches for new features or bug fixes.
   - Open pull requests for code review and merging.

## Tips

- Use branch policies to enforce code reviews and build validation.
- Protect main branches from direct pushes.
