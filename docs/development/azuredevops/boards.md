Azure Boards provides comprehensive agile project management tools for planning, tracking, and discussing work across development teams, supporting Scrum, Kanban, and hybrid methodologies.

## üéØ **Overview**

Azure Boards enables teams to:

- **Plan and track work** with customizable work items and hierarchies
- **Visualize workflows** using Kanban boards and sprint backlogs
- **Collaborate effectively** with built-in discussion and notification features
- **Monitor progress** through dashboards, charts, and analytics
- **Scale agile practices** from small teams to large enterprises
- **Integrate seamlessly** with repositories, pipelines, and testing tools

## üìã **Work Items and Hierarchies**

### Understanding Work Item Types

Azure Boards supports multiple work item types that form natural hierarchies:

#### Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí User Story ‚Üí Task

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Epic: Customer Portal] --> B[Feature: User Authentication]
    A --> C[Feature: Payment Processing]
    B --> D[User Story: Login Page]
    B --> E[User Story: Password Reset]
    D --> F[Task: Design Login UI]
    D --> G[Task: Implement Authentication]
    E --> H[Task: Email Integration]
    E --> I[Task: Reset Flow Logic]
```

### Work Item Types by Process Template

| Process Template | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Basic** | Epic | Issue | Task | - |
| **Agile** | Epic | Feature | User Story | Task |
| **Scrum** | Epic | Feature | Product Backlog Item | Task |
| **CMMI** | Epic | Feature | Requirement | Task |

### Creating and Configuring Work Items

## üìä **Boards and Kanban Management**

### Kanban Board Configuration

#### Basic Kanban Flow

```text
New ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Resolved ‚Üí Closed
```

#### Advanced Development Flow

```text
New ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí Committed ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí In Review ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Done
```

### Board Customization

#### Column Configuration

```json
{
  "boardColumns": [
    {
      "name": "New",
      "description": "Work items ready for planning",
      "wipLimit": null,
      "stateMappings": ["New"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Active",
      "description": "Work in progress",
      "wipLimit": 5,
      "stateMappings": ["Active", "Committed"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Code Review",
      "description": "Pending code review",
      "wipLimit": 3,
      "stateMappings": ["Review"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Testing",
      "description": "Quality assurance validation",
      "wipLimit": 4,
      "stateMappings": ["Testing"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Done",
      "description": "Completed work",
      "wipLimit": null,
      "stateMappings": ["Resolved", "Closed"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits

```markdown
### WIP Limit Guidelines

**Benefits:**
- Reduce context switching
- Improve flow and cycle time
- Identify bottlenecks quickly
- Enhance team focus

**Recommended Limits:**
- Development: 1-2 items per developer
- Code Review: 2-3 items total
- Testing: 3-4 items total
- Waiting/Blocked: Monitor but don't limit

**Implementation:**
1. Start with current capacity + 1
2. Monitor flow for 1-2 weeks
3. Adjust based on bottlenecks
4. Gradually reduce to optimal flow
```

### Board Rules and Automation

#### Automated Board Rules

```yaml
Rules:
  - name: "Auto-assign to creator"
    trigger: "Work item created"
    condition: "Assigned To is empty"
    action: "Set Assigned To = Created By"
  
  - name: "Move to In Progress"
    trigger: "State changed to Active"
    condition: "Work Item Type = Task"
    action: "Move to Active column"
  
  - name: "Tag high priority items"
    trigger: "Priority changed to 1"

#### Pre-Planning Activities

```markdown
### Sprint Planning Checklist

**1 Week Before Sprint Planning:**
- [ ] Product backlog refined and prioritized
- [ ] User stories have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Story points estimated
- [ ] Dependencies identified and resolved
- [ ] Team capacity calculated

**Sprint Planning Meeting:**

        [int]$HoursPerDay = 8
    )
    
    $totalHours = $SprintDays * $TeamSize * $HoursPerDay
    $availableHours = $totalHours * $FocusFactor
    
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        SprintDays = $SprintDays
        TeamSize = $TeamSize
        TotalHours = $totalHours
        AvailableHours = $availableHours
        FocusFactor = $FocusFactor
        RecommendedStoryPoints = [math]::Round($availableHours / 6, 0) # Assume 6 hours per story point
    }
}

# Example usage
Calculate-SprintCapacity -SprintDays 10 -TeamSize 6 -FocusFactor 0.75
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Large Project Management

```yaml
Scaling Strategies:
  Project Size: 
    - Small (1-3 teams): Single project approach
    - Medium (4-10 teams): Multiple projects with delivery plans
    - Large (10+ teams): Portfolio management with SAFe

  Work Item Management:
    - Archive completed iterations older than 6 months
    - Use work item templates for consistency
    - Implement bulk update operations
    - Regular cleanup of unused queries and dashboards

  Performance Tips:
    - Limit query results to essential fields
    - Use Analytics instead of WIQL for complex reports
    - Implement proper area and iteration path structure
    - Regular maintenance of work item links
```

### Governance and Compliance

#### Process Governance

```markdown
### Governance Framework

**Work Item Standards:**
- Mandatory fields configuration
- Approval workflows for high-impact items
- Audit trails for compliance requirements
- Regular process review and improvement

**Quality Gates:**
- Definition of Ready for backlog items
- Definition of Done for completed work
- Code review requirements
- Testing and acceptance criteria

**Reporting Requirements:**
- Executive dashboards for stakeholders
- Compliance reporting for audits
- Performance metrics for continuous improvement
- Risk and dependency tracking
```

## üîç **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### Performance Issues

```powershell
# Query optimization script
function Optimize-WorkItemQueries {
    param(
        [string]$Organization,
        [string]$Project,
        [string]$Pat
    )
    
    $headers = @{
        Authorization = "Basic $([Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(":$Pat")))"
    }
    
    # Get all queries
    $uri = "$Organization/$Project/_apis/wit/queries?`$depth=2&api-version=6.0"
    $queries = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Headers $headers
    
    # Analyze query performance
    foreach ($query in $queries.value) {
        if ($query.wiql) {
            $queryLength = $query.wiql.Length
            $hasSelectStar = $query.wiql -match "SELECT \*"
            $hasLargeResultSet = $query.wiql -notmatch "TOP \d+"
            
            if ($queryLength -gt 1000 -or $hasSelectStar -or $hasLargeResultSet) {
                Write-Warning "Query '$($query.name)' may have performance issues"
                Write-Host "  - Length: $queryLength characters"
                Write-Host "  - Uses SELECT *: $hasSelectStar"
                Write-Host "  - No TOP clause: $hasLargeResultSet"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Common Error Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **TF401349: Work item does not exist** | Work item deleted or insufficient permissions | Check permissions and verify work item ID |
| **VS402337: The iteration path is not valid** | Incorrect iteration path format | Verify iteration path structure and permissions |
| **TF14044: Access denied connecting to Team Foundation Server** | Authentication or permission issues | Check PAT token and project permissions |
| **TF26204: The work item type does not exist** | Invalid work item type for process template | Use correct work item type for your process |
