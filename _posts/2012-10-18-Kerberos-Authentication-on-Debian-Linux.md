This should be a fun experiment.

First I found this article:
<a href="http://zeldor.biz/2010/12/debian-join-windows-domain/">Debian join windows domain</a>

I had a problem with the following error:

"kinit: KDC reply did not match expectations while getting initial credentials"

Solution seems to be that it likes to have the kerberos realm entered in all upper-case. Who knew....

I am able to receive a ticket from the KDC.

To be continued....


....Later that same day.

Got kerberos, Samba, and Winbind configured and working with the home network. I was able to log into my network management host with domain credentials.

Pretty cool stuff.
