Using LDAP over SSL is a good step towards security. Improve security just a little bit more by disabling SSLv2 and forcing your clients to use SSLv3

On each of your domain controllers create the following registry key:
{% highlight powershell %}
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders
\SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 2.0]
{% endhighlight %}
Then create the following DWORD
{% highlight powershell %}
DWORD = "Enabled"
Value = 00000000
{% endhighlight %}
Finally, reboot the domain controller

To make this even easier you can deploy this registry key though a Group Policy Object linked to the Domain Controllers OU.
