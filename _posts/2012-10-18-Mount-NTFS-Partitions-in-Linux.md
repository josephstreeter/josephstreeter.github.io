I have a couple dual-boot machines with Microsoft Windows 7 Pro and Debian Linux. It would be nice to dump Microsoft but it's a sad truth that I just can't dump windows.

Sometimes I need to get something off of the Microsoft side of the show. It's nice to be able to mount the NTFS partition in Linux and get the files that I need.

With an distro like Debian it's easy enough to just install the ntfs-3g with the package manager, but the steps to mount the partition are the same.
