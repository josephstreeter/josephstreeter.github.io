I needed a complete list of all the IP addresses for the 192.168.0.0/16 network. The list was to be used to populate a table in the network management database I was creating.

Rather than sit and type all those IP addresses out I wrote a script in VBScript to do it instead.

Here is the script:
{% highlight powershell %}
for i = 0 to 255
for x = 0 to 255
wscript.echo "192.168." & i & "." & x
next
next
{% endhighlight %}
Change the first two octets for whatever network you need.

run the following command:
{% highlight powershell %}
cscript ip-address.vbs > ip-address.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure you don't execute the script with wscript or you'll be clicking 'ok' a lot!

**Update**
Here is the same script written to write the information directly to a text file in the root of C:\.

{% highlight powershell %}
set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
set ts = fso.CreateTextFile("c:\ip-address.txt", true)

for i = 0 to 255
for x = 0 to 255
ts.writeline("192.168." & i & "." & x)
next
next
{% endhighlight %}
