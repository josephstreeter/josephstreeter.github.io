PowerShell will automatically create a PSDrive for the Active Directory domain that the client is a member of. An additional PSDrive can be created for a different domain in another forest.

First, make sure that the Active Directory PowerShell module is loaded.
{% highlight powershell %}import-module activedirectory{% endhighlight %}
Now you can create the connection with the New-PSDrive commandlet.
{% highlight powershell %}New-PSDrive `
â€“Name <PSDrive-Name> `
â€“PSProvider ActiveDirectory `
â€“Server "<Domain-Controller>" `
â€“Credential (Get-Credential "<User-Name>") `
â€“Root "//RootDSE/" `
-Scope Global{% endhighlight %}
The new PSDrive can be used in several ways. Lets say that you have a test AD forest that you want to manage with PowerShell from a host joined to your production AD forest. The test forest has a domain controller named "dc-test-01.test.domain.com" that is providing the AD web service. The following command will create a PSDrive named "TEST" that will be connected to the "test.domain.com" domain.

If you're going to run this cmd-let from a script you will have to make sure that you include the "-Scope Global" switch. Otherwise the PSDrive will be created within the scope of the script and will not be available to you in the shell.


{% highlight powershell %}New-PSDrive `
â€“Name TEST `
â€“PSProvider ActiveDirectory `
â€“Server "dc-test-01.test.domain.com" `
â€“Credential (Get-Credential "TEST\jsmith-da") `
â€“Root "//RootDSE/" `
-Scope Global{% endhighlight %}
To use this PSDrive you can "cd" to the "TEST" PSDrive and then run the Active Directory modules as normal:
{% highlight powershell %}PS C:\> cd TEST:
PS C:\> Get-ADDomain{% endhighlight %}
The second method is to provide the "server" switch with the name of the domain controller:
{% highlight powershell %}PS C:\> Get-ADDomain -server "dc-test-01.test.domain.com"{% endhighlight %}
The following code will check to see if the drive exists prior to attempting creation of the new PSDrive
{% highlight powershell %}if (-not(Get-PSDrive TEST)) {
New-PSDrive `
â€“Name TEST `
â€“PSProvider ActiveDirectory `
â€“Server "dc-test-01.test.domain.com" `
â€“Credential (Get-Credential 'TEST\jsmith-da') `
â€“Root '//RootDSE/' `
-Scope Global
}Else{
"Drive already exists"
}{% endhighlight %}
